The \`ID\` scalar type represents a unique identifier, often used to refetch an object or as key for a cache. The ID type appears in a JSON response as a String; however, it is not intended to be human-readable. When expected as an input type, any string (such as \`"4"\`) or integer (such as \`4\`) input value will be accepted as an ID.
