  \\"\\"\\"
  A data service URI with a $orderby System Query Option specifies an expression
  for determining what values are used to order the collection of Entries
  identified by the Resource Path section of the URI. This query option is only
  supported when the resource path identifies a Collection of Entries.
  \\"\\"\\"
  orderby: String

  \\"\\"\\"
  A data service URI with a $top System Query Option identifies a subset of the
  Entries in the Collection of Entries identified by the Resource Path section
  of the URI. This subset is formed by selecting only the first N items of the
  set, where N is an integer greater than or equal to zero specified by this
  query option. If a value less than zero is specified, the URI should be
  considered malformed.
  \\"\\"\\"
  top: Int

  \\"\\"\\"
  A data service URI with a $skip System Query Option identifies a subset of the
  Entries in the Collection of Entries identified by the Resource Path section
  of the URI. That subset is defined by seeking N Entries into the Collection
  and selecting only the remaining Entries (starting with Entry N+1). N is an
  integer greater than or equal to zero specified by this query option. If a
  value less than zero is specified, the URI should be considered malformed.
  \\"\\"\\"
  skip: Int

  \\"\\"\\"
  A URI with a $filter System Query Option identifies a subset of the Entries
  from the Collection of Entries identified by the Resource Path section of the
  URI. The subset is determined by selecting only the Entries that satisfy the
  predicate expression specified by the query option.
  \\"\\"\\"
  filter: String

  \\"\\"\\"
  A URI with a $inlinecount System Query Option specifies that the response to
  the request includes a count of the number of Entries in the Collection of
  Entries identified by the Resource Path section of the URI. The count must be
  calculated after applying any $filter System Query Options present in the URI.
  The set of valid values for the $inlinecount query option are shown in the
  table below. If a value other than one shown in Table 4 is specified the URI
  is considered malformed.
