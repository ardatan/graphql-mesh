  \\"\\"\\"
  A data service URI with a $orderby System Query Option specifies an expression for determining what values are used to order the collection of Entries identified by the Resource Path section of the URI. This query option is only supported when the resource path identifies a Collection of Entries.
  \\"\\"\\"
  orderby: String

  \\"\\"\\"
  A data service URI with a $top System Query Option identifies a subset of the Entries in the Collection of Entries identified by the Resource Path section of the URI. This subset is formed by selecting only the first N items of the set, where N is an integer greater than or equal to zero specified by this query option. If a value less than zero is specified, the URI should be considered malformed.
  \\"\\"\\"
  top: Int

  \\"\\"\\"
  A data service URI with a $skip System Query Option identifies a subset of the Entries in the Collection of Entries identified by the Resource Path section of the URI. That subset is defined by seeking N Entries into the Collection and selecting only the remaining Entries (starting with Entry N+1). N is an integer greater than or equal to zero specified by this query option. If a value less than zero is specified, the URI should be considered malformed.
  \\"\\"\\"
  skip: Int

  \\"\\"\\"
  A URI with a $filter System Query Option identifies a subset of the Entries from the Collection of Entries identified by the Resource Path section of the URI. The subset is determined by selecting only the Entries that satisfy the predicate expression specified by the query option.
  \\"\\"\\"
  filter: String

  \\"\\"\\"
  A URI with a $inlinecount System Query Option specifies that the response to the request includes a count of the number of Entries in the Collection of Entries identified by the Resource Path section of the URI. The count must be calculated after applying any $filter System Query Options present in the URI. The set of valid values for the $inlinecount query option are shown in the table below. If a value other than one shown in Table 4 is specified the URI is considered malformed.

  The OData MUST include a count of the number of entities in the collection identified by the URI (after applying any $filter System Query Options present on the URI)

  The OData service MUST NOT include a count in the response. This is equivalence to a URI that does not include a $inlinecount query string parameter.

    A string representing a duration conforming to the ISO8601 standard,
    such as: P1W1DT13H23M34S
    P is the duration designator (for period) placed at the start of the duration representation.
    Y is the year designator that follows the value for the number of years.
    M is the month designator that follows the value for the number of months.
    W is the week designator that follows the value for the number of weeks.
    D is the day designator that follows the value for the number of days.
    T is the time designator that precedes the time components of the representation.
    H is the hour designator that follows the value for the number of hours.
    M is the minute designator that follows the value for the number of minutes.
    S is the second designator that follows the value for the number of seconds.

    Note the time designator, T, that precedes the time value.

    Matches moment.js, Luxon and DateFns implementations
    ,/. is valid for decimal places and +/- is a valid prefix
