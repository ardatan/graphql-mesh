    OAuth access tokens are used to grant authorized access to USPS&#174; APIs. Access tokens will expire, requiring applications to periodically check the expiration time and get new tokens.

    The following __OAuth 2.0__ grant types are supported:

    * _**Client Credentials**_: The token request exchanges the client Id and secret to get an access token. The client Id and secret are the credentials for your client application and are validated.
    * _**Refresh Token**_: The refresh token is exchanged to get a new access token and an optional refresh token. The refresh token is validated and must not have expired or been revoked.
    * _**Authorization Code**_: The token request exchanges an authorization code previously received for access and refresh tokens. User (Resource Owner) authentication and consent is prerequisite for authorization code generation. The authorization code is validated and must not have expired.

    Other OAuth flows may become supported in future releases.You will need to add an app to get a client Id and secret. These are the _**Consumer Key**_ and _**Consumer Secret**_ values in the API developer portal.

    Each API will stipulate the level of authentication assurance required to access its resources, either *Client Application* or *Resource Owner* credentials. The value in the `access_token` field of the /token response is placed in the _**Authorization**_ header in accordance with the *Bearer* token authentication scheme. See example value below (bearer token string truncated):

    * Authorization: Bearer `eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJ1c3BzLmNvbSIsInN1YiI6IjI0ODI4OTc2MTAwMSIsImF1ZCI6InM2QmhkUmtxdDMiLCJub25jZSI6Im4tMFM2X1d6QT` ......

    Each API will validate the access token, its expiration in addition to its OAuth scope for example. There may be further validations required which are specific to the resource being accessed.You will need to get a new access token once the one you have has expired. It is best practice to get a new access token before expiration if further access to resources is needed. You may also revoke a refresh token which you suspect has been disclosed or dispose it when it is no longer needed.

        Issue one or more OAuth tokens for a client application to use in making subsequent resource requests. Based on the _OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework_, IETF Draft RFC 6749, October 2012, see [IETF 6749](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749). **Access tokens are valid for eight hours after issuance, while refresh tokens are valid for seven days**.

        Note that the following OAuth grant types are supported:
        - **Client Credentials Grant**, see [IETF 6749, section 4.4](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.4).
        - **Refresh Token**, see [IETF 6749, section 6](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-6)
        - **Authorization Code Grant**, see [IETF 6749, section 4.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.1).
