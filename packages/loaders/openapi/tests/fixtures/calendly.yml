        * Pass `organization` parameter to return events for that organization (requires admin/owner privilege)
        * Pass `user` parameter to return events for a specific User

        **NOTES:**
        * If you are the admin/owner of the organization, you can use both `organization` and `user` to get a list of events for a specific user within your organization.

        * `user` can only be used alone when requesting your own personal events. This will return your events within any organization that you are currently in or were a part of in the past.
