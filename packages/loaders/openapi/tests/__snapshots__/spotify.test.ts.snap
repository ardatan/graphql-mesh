The timbre feature is a vector that includes 12 unbounded values roughly centered around 0. Those values are high level abstractions of the spectral surface, ordered by degree of importance.
  
  For completeness however, the first dimension represents the average loudness of the segment; second emphasizes brightness; third is more closely correlated to the flatness of a sound; fourth to sounds with a stronger attack; etc. See an image below representing the 12 basis functions (i.e. template segments).
  ![timbre basis functions](https://developer.spotify.com/assets/audio/Timbre_basis_functions.png)
