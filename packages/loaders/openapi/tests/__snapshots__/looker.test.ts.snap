  will be in the \`errors\` property of the response object. The 'data' property will be empty.
  
  For all other result formats: \`query_task_results()\` will respond with HTTP status \`400 Bad Request\` and some db SQL error info
  will be in the message of the 400 error response, but not as detailed as expressed in \`json_detail.errors\`.
  These data formats can only carry row data, and error info is not row data.

  ### Get a previously created query by id.
  
  A Looker query object includes the various parameters that define a database query that has been run or
  could be run in the future. These parameters include: model, view, fields, filters, pivots, etc.
  Query *results* are not part of the query object.
  
  Query objects are unique and immutable. Query objects are created automatically in Looker as users explore data.
  Looker does not delete them; they become part of the query history. When asked to create a query for
  any given set of parameters, Looker will first try to find an existing query object with matching
  parameters and will only create a new object when an appropriate object can not be found.
  
  This 'get' method is used to get the details about a query for a given id. See the other methods here
  to 'create' and 'run' queries.
  
  Note that some fields like 'filter_config' and 'vis_config' etc are specific to how the Looker UI
  builds queries and visualizations and are not generally useful for API use. They are not required when
  creating new queries and can usually just be ignored.

  ### Get the query for a given query slug.
  
  This returns the query for the 'slug' in a query share URL.
  
  The 'slug' is a randomly chosen short string that is used as an alternative to the query's id value
  for use in URLs etc. This method exists as a convenience to help you use the API to 'find' queries that
  have been created using the Looker UI.
  
  You can use the Looker explore page to build a query and then choose the 'Share' option to
  show the share url for the query. Share urls generally look something like 'https://looker.yourcompany/x/vwGSbfc'.
  The trailing 'vwGSbfc' is the share slug. You can pass that string to this api method to get details about the query.
  Those details include the 'id' that you can use to run the query. Or, you can copy the query body
  (perhaps with your own modification) and use that as the basis to make/run new queries.
  
  This will also work with slugs from Looker explore urls like
  'https://looker.yourcompany/explore/ecommerce/orders?qid=aogBgL6o3cKK1jN3RoZl5s'. In this case
  'aogBgL6o3cKK1jN3RoZl5s' is the slug.

  ### Run an URL encoded query.
  
  This requires the caller to encode the specifiers for the query into the URL query part using
  Looker-specific syntax as explained below.
  
  Generally, you would want to use one of the methods that takes the parameters as json in the POST body
  for creating and/or running queries. This method exists for cases where one really needs to encode the
  parameters into the URL of a single 'GET' request. This matches the way that the Looker UI formats
  'explore' URLs etc.
  
  The parameters here are very similar to the json body formatting except that the filter syntax is
  tricky. Unfortunately, this format makes this method not currently callable via the 'Try it out!' button
  in this documentation page. But, this is callable when creating URLs manually or when using the Looker SDK.
  
  Here is an example inline query URL:
  
  \`\`\`
  https://looker.mycompany.com:19999/api/3.0/queries/models/thelook/views/inventory_items/run/json?fields=category.name,inventory_items.days_in_inventory_tier,products.count&f[category.name]=socks&sorts=products.count+desc+0&limit=500&query_timezone=America/Los_Angeles
  \`\`\`
  
  When invoking this endpoint with the Ruby SDK, pass the query parameter parts as a hash. The hash to match the above would look like:
  
  \`\`\`ruby
  query_params =
  {
    fields: "category.name,inventory_items.days_in_inventory_tier,products.count",
    :"f[category.name]" => "socks",
    sorts: "products.count desc 0",
    limit: "500",
    query_timezone: "America/Los_Angeles"
  }
  response = ruby_sdk.run_url_encoded_query('thelook','inventory_items','json', query_params)
  
  \`\`\`
  
  Again, it is generally easier to use the variant of this method that passes the full query in the POST body.
  This method is available for cases where other alternatives won't fit the need.

  LDAP is enabled or disabled for Looker using the **enabled** field.
  
  Looker will never return an **auth_password** field. That value can be set, but never retrieved.

  ### Search Looks
  
  Returns an **array of Look objects** that match the specified search criteria.
  
  If multiple search params are given and \`filter_or\` is FALSE or not specified,
  search params are combined in a logical AND operation.
  Only rows that match *all* search param criteria will be returned.
  
  If \`filter_or\` is TRUE, multiple search params are combined in a logical OR operation.
  Results will include rows that match **any** of the search criteria.
  
  String search params use case-insensitive matching.

  or exclude (respectively) rows where the column is null.

  | \`end_at\` only | Find themes active at or before \`end_at\`
  | both set | Find themes with an active inclusive period between \`begin_at\` and \`end_at\`

  String search params can contain \`%\` and '_' as SQL LIKE pattern match wildcard expressions.
  example="dan%" will match "danger" and "Danzig" but not "David"
  example="D_m%" will match "Damage" and "dump"
  
  Integer search params can accept a single value or a comma separated list of values. The multiple

  ### Get information about the user with a credential of given type with specific id.
  
  This is used to do things like find users by their embed external_user_id. Or, find the user with
  a given api3 client_id, etc. The 'credential_type' matches the 'type' name of the various credential
  types. It must be one of the values listed in the table below. The 'credential_id' is your unique Id

  ### Get A Workspace
  
  Returns information about a workspace such as the git status and selected branches
  of all projects available to the caller's user account.
  
  A workspace defines which versions of project files will be used to evaluate expressions
  and operations that use model definitions - operations such as running queries or rendering dashboards.
  Each project has its own git repository, and each project in a workspace may be configured to reference
  particular branch or revision within their respective repositories.
  
  There are two predefined workspaces available: "production" and "dev".
  
  The production workspace is shared across all Looker users. Models in the production workspace are read-only.
  Changing files in production is accomplished by modifying files in a git branch and using Pull Requests
  to merge the changes from the dev branch into the production branch, and then telling
  Looker to sync with production.
  
  The dev workspace is local to each Looker user. Changes made to project/model files in the dev workspace only affect
  that user, and only when the dev workspace is selected as the active workspace for the API session.
  (See set_session_workspace()).
  
  The dev workspace is NOT unique to an API session. Two applications accessing the Looker API using
  the same user account will see the same files in the dev workspace. To avoid collisions between
  API clients it's best to have each client login with API credentials for a different user account.
  
  Changes made to files in a dev workspace are persistent across API sessions. It's a good
  idea to commit any changes you've made to the git repository, but not strictly required. Your modified files
  reside in a special user-specific directory on the Looker server and will still be there when you login in again
  later and use update_session(workspace_id: "dev") to select the dev workspace for the new API session.

  ### Present client credentials to obtain an authorization token
  
  Looker API implements the OAuth2 [Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant](https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/r/api/outh2_resource_owner_pc) pattern.
  The client credentials required for this login must be obtained by creating an API key on a user account
  in the Looker Admin console. The API key consists of a public \`client_id\` and a private \`client_secret\`.
  
  The access token returned by \`login\` must be used in the HTTP Authorization header of subsequent
  API requests, like this:
  \`\`\`
  Authorization: token 4QDkCyCtZzYgj4C2p2cj3csJH7zqS5RzKs2kTnG4
  \`\`\`
  Replace "4QDkCy..." with the \`access_token\` value returned by \`login\`.
  The word \`token\` is a string literal and must be included exactly as shown.
  
  This function can accept \`client_id\` and \`client_secret\` parameters as URL query params or as www-form-urlencoded params in the body of the HTTP request. Since there is a small risk that URL parameters may be visible to intermediate nodes on the network route (proxies, routers, etc), passing credentials in the body of the request is considered more secure than URL params.
  
  Example of passing credentials in the HTTP request body:
  \`\`\`\`
  POST HTTP /login
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  
  client_id=CGc9B7v7J48dQSJvxxx&client_secret=nNVS9cSS3xNpSC9JdsBvvvvv
  \`\`\`\`
  
  ### Best Practice:
  Always pass credentials in body params. Pass credentials in URL query params **only** when you cannot pass body params due to application, tool, or other limitations.

  ### Create an access token that runs as a given user.
  
  This can only be called by an authenticated admin user. It allows that admin to generate a new
  authentication token for the user with the given user id. That token can then be used for subsequent
  API calls - which are then performed *as* that target user.
  
  The target user does *not* need to have a pre-existing API client_id/client_secret pair. And, no such
  credentials are created by this call.
  
  This allows for building systems where api user authentication for an arbitrary number of users is done
  outside of Looker and funneled through a single 'service account' with admin permissions. Note that a
  new access token is generated on each call. If target users are going to be making numerous API
  calls in a short period then it is wise to cache this authentication token rather than call this before
  each of those API calls.
  
  See 'login' for more detail on the access token and how to use it.

    { "key": "three", "value": "creating new three" },
  ]
  \`\`\`
  
  Notes for this body:
  
  - The \`value\` for \`key\` **one** is a JSON payload, so a \`content_type\` override is needed. This override must be done **every** time a JSON value is set.
  - The \`version\` values for **one** and **two** mean they have been saved 10 and 20 times, respectively.
  - If \`version\` is **not** provided for an existing artifact, the entire request will be refused and a \`Bad Request\` response will be sent.
  - If \`version\` is provided for an artifact, it is only used for helping to prevent inadvertent data overwrites. It cannot be used to **set** the version of an artifact. The Looker server controls \`version\`.
  - We suggest encoding binary values as base64. Because the MIME content type for base64 is detected as plain text, also provide \`content_type\` to correctly indicate the value's type for retrieval and client-side processing.
  
  Because artifacts are stored encrypted, the same value can be written multiple times (provided the correct \`version\` number is used). Looker does not examine any values stored in the artifact store, and only decrypts when sending artifacts back in an API response.
  
  **Note**: The artifact storage API can only be used by Looker-built extensions.

  ### Create SSO Embed URL
  
  Creates an SSO embed URL and cryptographically signs it with an embed secret.
  This signed URL can then be used to instantiate a Looker embed session in a PBL web application.
  Do not make any modifications to this URL - any change may invalidate the signature and
  cause the URL to fail to load a Looker embed session.
  
  A signed SSO embed URL can only be used once. After it has been used to request a page from the
  Looker server, the URL is invalid. Future requests using the same URL will fail. This is to prevent
  'replay attacks'.
  
  The \`target_url\` property must be a complete URL of a Looker UI page - scheme, hostname, path and query params.
  To load a dashboard with id 56 and with a filter of \`Date=1 years\`, the looker URL would look like \`https:/myname.looker.com/dashboards/56?Date=1%20years\`.
  The best way to obtain this target_url is to navigate to the desired Looker page in your web browser,
  copy the URL shown in the browser address bar and paste it into the \`target_url\` property as a quoted string value in this API request.
  
  Permissions for the embed user are defined by the groups in which the embed user is a member (group_ids property)
  and the lists of models and permissions assigned to the embed user.
  At a minimum, you must provide values for either the group_ids property, or both the models and permissions properties.
  These properties are additive; an embed user can be a member of certain groups AND be granted access to models and permissions.
  
  The embed user's access is the union of permissions granted by the group_ids, models, and permissions properties.
  
  This function does not strictly require all group_ids, user attribute names, or model names to exist at the moment the
  SSO embed url is created. Unknown group_id, user attribute names or model names will be passed through to the output URL.
  To diagnose potential problems with an SSO embed URL, you can copy the signed URL into the Embed URI Validator text box in \`<your looker instance>/admin/embed\`.
  
  The \`secret_id\` parameter is optional. If specified, its value must be the id of an active secret defined in the Looker instance.
  if not specified, the URL will be signed using the newest active secret defined in the Looker instance.
  
  #### Security Note
  Protect this signed URL as you would an access token or password credentials - do not write
  it to disk, do not pass it to a third party, and only pass it through a secure HTTPS
  encrypted transport.

  ### Create an Embed URL
  
  Creates an embed URL that runs as the Looker user making this API call. ("Embed as me")
  This embed URL can then be used to instantiate a Looker embed session in a
  "Powered by Looker" (PBL) web application.
  
  This is similar to Private Embedding (https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/r/admin/embed/private-embed). Instead of
  of logging into the Web UI to authenticate, the user has already authenticated against the API to be able to
  make this call. However, unlike Private Embed where the user has access to any other part of the Looker UI,
  the embed web session created by requesting the EmbedUrlResponse.url in a browser only has access to
  content visible under the \`/embed\` context.
  
  An embed URL can only be used once, and must be used within 5 minutes of being created. After it
  has been used to request a page from the Looker server, the URL is invalid. Future requests using
  the same URL will fail. This is to prevent 'replay attacks'.

  ### Acquire a cookieless embed session.
  
  The acquire session endpoint negates the need for signing the embed url and passing it as a parameter
  to the embed login. This endpoint accepts an embed user definition and creates or updates it. This is
  similar behavior to the embed SSO login as they both can create and update embed user data.
  
  The endpoint also accepts an optional \`session_reference_token\`. If present and the session has not expired
  and the credentials match the credentials for the embed session, a new authentication token will be
  generated. This allows the embed session to attach a new embedded IFRAME to the embed session. Note that
  the session is NOT extended in this scenario. In other words the session_length parameter is ignored.
  
  **IMPORTANT:** If the \`session_reference_token\` is provided and the session has NOT expired, the embed user
  is NOT updated. This is done for performance reasons and to support the embed SSO usecase where the
  first IFRAME created on a page uses a signed url and subsequently created IFRAMEs do not.
  
  If the \`session_reference_token\` is provided but the session has expired, the token will be ignored and a
  new embed session will be created. Note that the embed user definition will be updated in this scenario.
  
  If the credentials do not match the credentials associated with an exisiting session_reference_token, a
  404 will be returned.
  
  The endpoint returns the following:
  - Authentication token - a token that is passed to \`/embed/login\` endpoint that creates or attaches to the
    embed session. This token can be used once and has a lifetime of 30 seconds.
  - Session reference token - a token that lives for the length of the session. This token is used to
    generate new api and navigation tokens OR create new embed IFRAMEs.
  - Api token - lives for 10 minutes. The Looker client will ask for this token once it is loaded into the
    iframe.
  - Navigation token - lives for 10 minutes. The Looker client will ask for this token once it is loaded into
    the iframe.

  ### Modify a Look
  
  Use this function to modify parts of a look. Property values given in a call to \`update_look\` are
  applied to the existing look, so there's no need to include properties whose values are not changing.
  It's best to specify only the properties you want to change and leave everything else out
  of your \`update_look\` call. **Look properties marked 'read-only' will be ignored.**
  
  When a user deletes a look in the Looker UI, the look data remains in the database but is
  marked with a deleted flag ("soft-deleted"). Soft-deleted looks can be undeleted (by an admin)
  if the delete was in error.
  
  To soft-delete a look via the API, use [update_look()](#!/Look/update_look) to change the look's \`deleted\` property to \`true\`.
  You can undelete a look by calling \`update_look\` to change the look's \`deleted\` property to \`false\`.
  
  Soft-deleted looks are excluded from the results of [all_looks()](#!/Look/all_looks) and [search_looks()](#!/Look/search_looks), so they
  essentially disappear from view even though they still reside in the db.
  In API 3.1 and later, you can pass \`deleted: true\` as a parameter to [search_looks()](#!/3.1/Look/search_looks) to list soft-deleted looks.
  
  NOTE: [delete_look()](#!/Look/delete_look) performs a "hard delete" - the look data is removed from the Looker
  database and destroyed. There is no "undo" for \`delete_look()\`.

  ### Create Merge Query
  
  Creates a new merge query object.
  
  A merge query takes the results of one or more queries and combines (merges) the results

  A merge query can merge results of queries from different SQL databases.

  first query in the array defines the primary key into which the results of subsequent
  queries will be merged.

  you make a request to create a new merge query that is identical to an existing merge query,
  the existing merge query will be returned instead of creating a duplicate. Conversely, any
  change to the contents of a merge query will produce a new object with a new id.

  ### Create a Scheduled Plan
  
  Create a scheduled plan to render a Look or Dashboard on a recurring schedule.
  
  To create a scheduled plan, you MUST provide values for the following fields:
  \`name\`
  and
  \`look_id\`, \`dashboard_id\`, \`lookml_dashboard_id\`, or \`query_id\`
  and
  \`cron_tab\` or \`datagroup\`
  and
  at least one scheduled_plan_destination
  
  A scheduled plan MUST have at least one scheduled_plan_destination defined.
  
  When \`look_id\` is set, \`require_no_results\`, \`require_results\`, and \`require_change\` are all required.
  
  If \`create_scheduled_plan\` fails with a 422 error, be sure to look at the error messages in the response which will explain exactly what fields are missing or values that are incompatible.
  
  The queries that provide the data for the look or dashboard are run in the context of user account that owns the scheduled plan.
  
  When \`run_as_recipient\` is \`false\` or not specified, the queries that provide the data for the
  look or dashboard are run in the context of user account that owns the scheduled plan.
  
  When \`run_as_recipient\` is \`true\` and all the email recipients are Looker user accounts, the
  queries are run in the context of each recipient, so different recipients may see different
  data from the same scheduled render of a look or dashboard. For more details, see [Run As Recipient](https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/r/admin/run-as-recipient).
  
  Admins can create and modify scheduled plans on behalf of other users by specifying a user id.
  Non-admin users may not create or modify scheduled plans by or for other users.

  ### Run a Scheduled Plan By Id Immediately
  This function creates a run-once schedule plan based on an existing scheduled plan,
  applies modifications (if any) to the new scheduled plan, and runs the new schedule plan immediately.
  This can be useful for testing modifications to an existing scheduled plan before committing to a production schedule.
  
  This function internally performs the following operations:
  
  1. Copies the properties of the existing scheduled plan into a new scheduled plan
  2. Copies any properties passed in the JSON body of this request into the new scheduled plan (replacing the original values)
  3. Creates the new scheduled plan
  4. Runs the new scheduled plan
  
  The original scheduled plan is not modified by this operation.
  Admins can create, modify, and run scheduled plans on behalf of other users by specifying a user id.
  Non-admins can only create, modify, and run their own scheduled plans.

  ### Define values for a user attribute across a set of groups, in priority order.
  
  This function defines all values for a user attribute defined by user groups. This is a global setting, potentially affecting
  all users in the system. This function replaces any existing group value definitions for the indicated user attribute.
  
  The value of a user attribute for a given user is determined by searching the following locations, in this order:
  
  1. the user's account settings
  2. the groups that the user is a member of
  3. the default value of the user attribute, if any
  
  The user may be a member of multiple groups which define different values for that user attribute. The order of items in the group_values parameter
  determines which group takes priority for that user. Lowest array index wins.
  
  An alternate method to indicate the selection precedence of group-values is to assign numbers to the 'rank' property of each
  group-value object in the array. Lowest 'rank' value wins. If you use this technique, you must assign a
  rank value to every group-value object in the array.
  
    To set a user attribute value for a single user, see [Set User Attribute User Value](#!/User/set_user_attribute_user_value).
