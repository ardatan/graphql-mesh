It can be used\\\\nfor the cases where a network connection was lost, before\\\\nthe envelope status could be returned.\\\\n\\\\nTo avoid unnecessary database queries, the DocuSign\\\\nsignature platform first checks requests to ensure that the\\\\nfilter set supplied does not result in a zero-size response\\\\nbefore querying the database. \\\\n\\\\nFor example, for a request with a \`from_to_status\` of\\\\n\`delivered\` and a current \`status\` of \`created,sent\`,\\\\nDocuSign will always return an empty list. \\\\nThis is because the request translates to: find the\\\\nenvelopes that were delivered between the \`from_date\` and\\\\n\`to_date\` dates that have a current status of \`created\` or\\\\n\`sent\`. Since an envelope that has been delivered can\\\\nnever have a status of \`created\` or \`sent\`, a zero-size\\\\nresponse would be generated. \\\\nIn this case, DocuSign does not query the database\\\\nand returns an empty list immediately.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe following table shows the valid current envelope\\\\nstatuses (\`status\` parameter) for the different status\\\\nqualifiers (\`from_to_status\` parameter) in the request. If\\\\nthe status and status qualifiers in the API request do not\\\\ncontain any of the values shown in the Valid Current\\\\nStatuses column, then an empty list is returned.\\\\n\\\\nClient applications should check that the statuses (\`status\`\\\\nparameter) they are requesting make sense for a given\\\\n\`from_to_status\` parameter value.\\\\n\\\\n| Status Qualifier<br>(\`from_to_status\`) | Effective Status Qualifier | Valid Current Statuses                                                      |  \\\\n| :------------------------------------- | :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |  \\\\n| any (changed)                          | StatusChanged              | any, created, sent, delivered, signed, completed, declined, voided, deleted |  \\\\n| created                                | Created                    | any, created, sent, delivered, signed, completed, declined, voided, deleted |  \\\\n| sent                                   | Sent                       | any, sent, delivered, signed, completed, declined, voided, deleted          |  \\\\n| delivered                              | StatusChanged              | any, delivered, signed, completed, declined, voided, deleted                |  \\\\n| signed                                 | StatusChanged              | any, signed, completed, declined, voided, deleted                           |  \\\\n| completed                              | Completed                  | any, completed, declined, voided, deleted                                   |  \\\\n| declined                               | StatusChanged              | any, declined, voided, deleted                                              |  \\\\n| timedout<br>always return zero results | StatusChanged              | any, voided, deleted                                                        |  \\\\n| voided                                 | Voided                     | any, voided, deleted                                                        |  \\\\n| deleted                                | StatusChanged              | any, deleted                                                                |  \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIn some cases, a request for a specific envelope status will\\\\ninclude envelopes with additional statuses.

In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process in initiated. However, when the sending application sets \`EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN\`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use.

When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. \\\\n\\\\nIf set to \`SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN\`, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation that is launched by any partner.\\\\n\\\\nIt is important to remember that in a typical embedded workflow the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application, DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own process for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process in initiated. However, when the sending application sets \`EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN\`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of the recipient.\\\\n\\\\nIf the \`clientUserId\` property is NOT set, and the \`embeddedRecipientStartURL\` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: envelopeId, recipientId, recipientName, recipientEmail, and customFields. The \`customFields\` property must be set fort the recipient or envelope.

When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. \\\\n\\\\nIf set to \`SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN\`, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation that is launched by any partner.\\\\n\\\\nIt is important to remember that in a typical embedded workflow the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application, DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own process for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process in initiated. However, when the sending application sets \`EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN\`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of the recipient.\\\\n\\\\nIf the \`clientUserId\` property is NOT set, and the \`embeddedRecipientStartURL\` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: envelopeId, recipientId, recipientName, recipientEmail, and customFields. The \`customFields\` property must be set fort the recipient or envelope.

Recipients are not asked to authenticate again when they access the documents from the same browser on the same device. If the recipient attempts to access the documents from a different browser or a different device, the recipient must pass authentication again. Once authenticated, that recipient is not challenged again on the new device or browser. The ability for a recipient to skip authentication for documents is limited to documents sent from the same sending account.</p></li> <li><p><code>each_access</code>: Authentication checks apply every time a recipient attempts to access the envelope.

application),\\\\ncan be defined in the \`envelopeDefinition\`,\\\\nin templates, by transforming PDF Form Fields,\\\\nor by using Composite Templates (see below).\\\\n\\\\nThe \`inPersonSigner\`, and \`signer\` recipient objects\\\\ninclude a \`tabs\` property.\\\\nIt is an [\`EnvelopeRecipientTabs\` resource object][envRecipientTabsDef]\\\\nthat includes arrays of the different tab types available.\\\\nSee the [\`EnvelopeRecipientTabs\` resource][envRecipientTabsRes] for more information.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nEnvelopes use specific people or groups as recipients.\\\\nTemplates can specify a role, eg \`account_manager.\`\\\\nWhen a template is used in an envelope,\\\\nthe roles must be replaced with specific people or groups.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you create an envelope using a \`templateId\`,\\\\nthe different recipient type objects\\\\nwithin the [\`EnvelopeRecipients\` property][envelopeRecipientsDef]\\\\nare used to assign recipients to the template's roles via the

feature,\\\\nlike [compositing in film production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositing),\\\\nenables you to overlay\\\\ndocument,\\\\nrecipient,\\\\nand tab definitions\\\\nfrom multiple sources,\\\\nincluding PDF Form Field definitions,\\\\ntemplates defined on the server,\\\\nand more.\\\\n\\\\nEach Composite Template consists of optional elements: server templates,\\\\ninline templates, PDF Metadata templates, and documents.\\\\n\\\\n* The Composite Template ID is an optional element used to identify the\\\\n  composite template. It is used as a reference when adding document\\\\n  object information via a multipart HTTP message. If used, the document\\\\n  content-disposition must include the \`compositeTemplateId\` to which the\\\\n  document should be added. If \`compositeTemplateId\` is not specified in\\\\n  the content-disposition, the document is applied based on the\\\\n  \`documentId\` only. If no document object is specified, the composite\\\\n  template inherits the first document.\\\\n\\\\n* Server Templates are server-side templates stored on the DocuSign\\\\n  platform. If supplied, they are overlaid into the envelope in the order\\\\n  of their Sequence value.\\\\n\\\\n* Inline Templates provide a container to add documents, recipients,\\\\n  tabs, and custom fields. If inline templates are supplied, they are\\\\n  overlaid into the envelope in the order of their Sequence value.\\\\n\\\\n* Document objects are optional structures that provide a container to\\\\n  pass in a document or form. If this object is not included, the\\\\n  composite template inherits the *first* document it finds from a server\\\\n  template or inline template, starting with the lowest sequence value.\\\\n\\\\nPDF Form objects are only transformed from the document object. DocuSign\\\\ndoes not derive PDF form properties from server templates or inline\\\\ntemplates. To instruct DocuSign to transform fields from the PDF form,\\\\nset \`transformPdfFields\` to **true** for the document.\\\\n\\\\nSee [PDF Form Field Transformation](#pdf-form-field-transformation)\\\\nfor more information about process.\\\\n\\\\n* PDF Metadata Templates provide a container to embed design-time\\\\n  template information into a PDF document. DocuSign uses this information\\\\n  when processing the Envelope. This convention allows the document to\\\\n  carry the signing instructions with it, so that less information needs\\\\n  to be provided at run-time through an inline template or synchronized\\\\n  with an external structure like a server template. PDF Metadata\\\\n  templates are stored in the Metadata layer of a PDF in accordance with\\\\n  Acrobat's XMP specification. DocuSign will only find PDF Metadata\\\\n  templates inside documents passed in the Document object (see below). If\\\\n  supplied, the PDF metadata template will be overlaid into the envelope\\\\n  in the order of its Sequence value.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nEach Composite Template adds a new document and templates overlay into\\\\nthe envelope. For each Composite Template these rules are applied:\\\\n\\\\n* Templates are overlaid in the order of their Sequence value.\\\\n* If Document is not passed into the Composite Template's \`document\`\\\\n  field, the *first* template's document (based on the template's Sequence\\\\n  value) is used.\\\\n* Last in wins in all cases except for the document (i.e. envelope\\\\n  information, recipient information, secure field information). There is\\\\n  no special casing.\\\\n\\\\nFor example, if you want higher security on a tab,\\\\nthen that needs to be specified in a later template (by sequence number)\\\\nthan where the tab is included.\\\\nIf you want higher security on a role recipient,\\\\nthen it needs to be in a later template\\\\nthan where that role recipient is specified.\\\\n\\\\n* Recipient matching is based on Recipient Role and Routing Order. If\\\\n  there are matches, the recipient information is merged together. A final\\\\n  pass is done on all Composite Templates, after all template overlays\\\\n  have been applied, to collapse recipients with the same email, username\\\\n  and routing order. This prevents having the same recipients at the same\\\\n  routing order.\\\\n\\\\n* If you specify in a template that a recipient is locked, once that\\\\n  recipient is overlaid the recipient attributes can no longer be changed.\\\\n  The only items that can be changed for the recipient in this case are\\\\n  the email, username, access code and IDCheckInformationInput.\\\\n\\\\n* Tab matching is based on Tab Labels, Tab Types and Documents. If a Tab\\\\n  Label matches but the Document is not supplied, the Tab is overlaid for\\\\n  all the Documents.\\\\n\\\\nFor example, if you have a simple inline template with only one tab in\\\\nit with a label and a value, the Signature, Initial, Company, Envelope\\\\nID, User Name tabs will only be matched and collapsed if they fall in\\\\nthe exact same X and Y locations.\\\\n\\\\n* \`roleName\` and \`tabLabel\` matching is case sensitive.\\\\n\\\\n* The \`defaultRecipient\` property enables you to specify which recipient\\\\n  the tabs generated from a PDF form are mapped to. You can also set PDF\\\\n  form generated tabs to a recipient other than the default recipient by\\\\n  specifying the mapping of the tab label that is created to one of the\\\\n  template recipients.\\\\n\\\\n* You can use \`tabLabel\` wild carding to map a series of tabs from the PDF\\\\n  form. To use this you must end a tab label with \\\\\\"\\\\\\\\*\\\\\\" and then the system\\\\n  matches tabs that start with the label.\\\\n\\\\n* If no \`defaultRecipient\` is specified, tabs must be explicitly mapped\\\\n  to recipients in order to be generated from the form. Unmapped form\\\\n  objects will not be generated into their DocuSign equivalents. (In the\\\\n  case of Signature/Initials, the tabs will be disregarded entirely; in\\\\n  the case of pdf text fields, the field data will be flattened on the\\\\n  Envelope document, but there will not be a corresponding DocuSign data\\\\n  tab.)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDocument content can be supplied inline, using the \`documentBase64\` or\\\\ncan be included in a multipart HTTP message. If a multipart message is\\\\nused and there are multiple Composite Templates, the document\\\\ncontent-disposition can include the \`compositeTemplateId\` to which the\\\\ndocument should be added. Using the \`compositeTemplateId\` sets which\\\\ndocuments are associated with particular composite templates. An example\\\\nof this usage is:\\\\n\\\\n\`\`\`\\\\n--5cd3320a-5aac-4453-b3a4-cbb52a4cba5d\\\\nContent-Type: application/pdf\\\\nContent-Disposition: file; filename=\\\\\\"eula.pdf\\\\\\"; documentId=1; compositeTemplateId=\\\\\\"1\\\\\\"\\\\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: base64\\\\n\`\`\`\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOnly the following PDF Form FieldTypes are transformed to DocuSign\\\\ntabs:\\\\n\\\\n* CheckBox\\\\n* DateTime\\\\n* ListBox\\\\n* Numeric\\\\n* Password\\\\n* Radio\\\\n* Signature,\\\\n* Text\\\\n\\\\nField Properties that are transformed:\\\\n\\\\n* Read Only\\\\n* Required\\\\n* Max Length\\\\n* Positions\\\\n* Initial Data\\\\n\\\\nWhen transforming a PDF Form Digital Signature Field, the following rules apply.\\\\nAny other PDF Form Digital Signature Field will be transformed to a DocuSign Signature tab\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n| If the PDF Field Name contains                              | Then the DocuSign tab will be |\\\\n| :---------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------- |\\\\n| DocuSignSignHere or<br> eSignSignHere                       | Signature                     |\\\\n| DocuSignSignHereOptional or<br> eSignSignHereOptional       | Optional Signature            |\\\\n| DocuSignInitialHere or<br> eSignInitialHere                 | Initials                      |\\\\n| DocuSignInitialHereOptional or<br> eSignInitialHereOptional | Optional Initials             |\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhen transforming PDF Form Text Fields, the following rules apply.\\\\nAny other PDF Form Text Field will be transformed to a DocuSign data (text) tab.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n| If the PDF Field Name contains                                        | Then the DocuSign tab will be |\\\\n| :-------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------- |\\\\n| DocuSignSignHere or<br> eSignSignHere                                 | Signature                     |\\\\n| DocuSignSignHereOptional or<br> eSignSignHereOptional                 | Optional Signature            |\\\\n| DocuSignInitialHere or<br> eSignInitialHere                           | Initials                      |\\\\n| DocuSignInitialHereOptional or<br> eSignInitialHereOptional           | Optional Initials             |\\\\n| DocuSignEnvelopeID or<br> eSignEnvelopeID                             | EnvelopeID                    |\\\\n| DocuSignCompany or<br> eSignCompany                                   | Company                       |\\\\n| DocuSignDateSigned or<br> eSignDateSigned                             | Date Signed                   |\\\\n| DocuSignTitle or<br> eSignTitle                                       | Title                         |\\\\n| DocuSignFullName or<br> eSignFullName                                 | Full Name                     |\\\\n| DocuSignSignerAttachmentOptional or<br> eSignSignerAttachmentOptional | Optional Signer Attachment    |\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPDF Form Field Names that include \`DocuSignIgnoreTransform\`\\\\nor \`eSignIgnoreTransform\` will not be transformed.\\\\n\\\\nPDF Form Date fields that include \`DocuSignDateSigned\` or \`eSignDateSigned\`\\\\nwill be transformed\\\\nto Date Signed fields.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThis feature enables you to insert recipient name and email address\\\\nmerge fields into the email subject line when creating or sending from a\\\\ntemplate.\\\\n\\\\nThe merge fields, based on the recipient's \`roleName\`, are added to the\\\\n\`emailSubject\` when the template is created or when the template is used\\\\nto create an envelope. After a template sender adds the name and email\\\\ninformation for the recipient and sends the envelope, the recipient\\\\ninformation is automatically merged into the appropriate fields in the\\\\nemail subject line.\\\\n\\\\nBoth the sender and the recipients will see the information in the email\\\\nsubject line for any emails associated with the template.

For cases where\\\\nthe recipient name or email is expected to be long, you should consider\\\\nplacing the merge field at the start of the email subject.\\\\n\\\\n* To add a recipient's name in the subject line add the following text\\\\n  in the \`emailSubject\` when creating the template or when sending an\\\\n  envelope from a template:\\\\n\\\\n   \`[[<roleName>_UserName]]\`\\\\n\\\\n   Example:\\\\n\\\\n   \`\\\\\\"emailSubject\\\\\\":\\\\\\"[[Signer 1_UserName]], Please sign this NDA\\\\\\"\`\\\\n\\\\n* To add a recipient's email address in the subject line add the\\\\n  following text in the emailSubject when creating the template or when\\\\n  sending an envelope from a template:\\\\n\\\\n   \`[[<roleName>_Email]]\`\\\\n\\\\n   Example:\\\\n\\\\n   \`\\\\\\"emailSubject\\\\\\":\\\\\\"[[Signer 1_Email]], Please sign this NDA\\\\\\"\`\\\\n\\\\nIn both cases \`<roleName>\` is the recipient's \`roleName\` in the template.\\\\n\\\\nFor cases where another recipient (such as an Agent, Editor, or\\\\nIntermediary recipient) is entering the name and email information for\\\\nthe recipient included in the email subject, then\\\\n\`[[<roleName>_UserName]]\` or \`[[<roleName>_Email]]\` is shown in the\\\\nemail subject.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe following rules are used to determine the \`brandId\` used in an envelope:\\\\n\\\\n* If a \`brandId\` is specified in the envelope or template\\\\n  and that \`brandId\` is available to the account,\\\\n  that brand is used in the envelope.\\\\n* If more than one template is used in an envelope,\\\\n  and more than one \`brandId\` is specified,\\\\n  the first \`brandId\` specified is used throughout the envelope.\\\\n* In cases where no brand is specified,\\\\n  and the sender belongs to a group:\\\\n  - If there is only one brand associated with the group,\\\\n    then that brand is used in the envelope.\\\\n  - Otherwise, the account's default signing brand is used.\\\\n* For envelopes that do not meet any of the previous criteria,\\\\n  the account's default signing brand is used for the envelope.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe BCC Email address feature\\\\nis designed to provide a copy\\\\nof all email communications for external archiving purposes.\\\\nDocuSign recommends that envelopes sent using the BCC for Email Archive feature,\\\\nincluding the BCC Email Override option,\\\\ninclude additional signer authentication options.\\\\n\\\\nDo **not** use this feature\\\\nto send a copy of the envelope\\\\nto a recipient who does not need to sign.\\\\nUse a Carbon Copy or Certified Delivery Recipient type instead.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhen an envelope with multiple templates is sent,\\\\nthe recipients from the templates are merged according to the template roles,\\\\nand empty recipients are removed.\\\\nWhen creating an envelope with multiple templates,\\\\nbut not sending it (keeping it in a created state),\\\\nduplicate recipients are not merged,\\\\nwhich could leave duplicate recipients in the envelope.\\\\n\\\\nTo prevent this,\\\\nthe query parameter \`merge_roles_on_draft\`\\\\nshould be added when posting a draft envelope (\`status\` is \`created\`)\\\\nwith multiple templates.\\\\nDoing this will merge template roles and remove empty recipients.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDocuSign recommends that the \`merge_roles_on_draft\` query\\\\nparameter be used any time you are creating an envelope with\\\\nmultiple templates and keeping it in draft (\`status\` is \`created\`) status.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n[agentDef]:                 #/definitions/agent\\\\n[apirules]:                 /esign/guide/appendix/resource_limits.html#api-rules-and-limits\\\\n[ccDef]:                     #/definitions/carbonCopy\\\\n[certfiedDef]:               #/definitions/certifiedDelivery\\\\n[connectConfigurationsRes]: /esign/restapi/Connect/ConnectConfigurations/\\\\n[connectGuide]:             https://www.docusign.com/supportdocs/pdf/connect-guide.pdf\\\\n[devecenterrecipients]:     https://www.docusign.com/developer-center/explore/features/recipients\\\\n[documentDef]:               #/definitions/document\\\\n[editorDef]:                 #/definitions/editor\\\\n[envelopeDef]:               #/definitions/envelopeDefinition\\\\n[envelopeRecipientsDef]:     #/definitions/EnvelopeRecipients\\\\n[envelopeRecipientsRes]:    /esign/restapi/Envelopes/EnvelopeRecipients/\\\\n[envRecipientTabsDef]:       #/definitions/EnvelopeRecipientTabs\\\\n[envRecipientTabsRes]:      /esign/restapi/Envelopes/EnvelopeRecipientTabs/\\\\n[eventNotificationDef]:      #/definitions/eventNotification\\\\n[inPersonDef]:               #/definitions/inPersonSigner\\\\n[intermediaryDef]:           #/definitions/intermediary\\\\n[signerDef]:                 #/definitions/signer\\\\n\\"

  \\"Returns a URL that enables you to embed the recipient view of the DocuSign UI in your applications. If the recipient is a signer, then the view will provide the signing ceremony.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThis method is only used with envelopes in the \`sent\` status.\\\\n\\\\nYour application is responsible for authenticating the identity of the recipient or signer when you use this method. Use the parameters \`assertionId\`, \`authenticationInstant\`, \`authenticationMethod\`, \`clientUserId\`, and \`securityDomain\` to record information on how the recipient was authenticated. At a minimum, \`authenticationMethod\` and \`clientUserId\` are required. The information that you provide is included in the envelope's certificate of completion.\\\\n\\\\nAfter the signer completes or ends the signing ceremony, DocuSign will redirect the user's browser back to your app via the \`returnUrl\` that you supply. DocuSIgn appends an \`event\` query parameter to the URL with the outcome of the signing ceremony. Your app should use the event parameter to determine the next step for the envelope. Don't fetch the envelope's status via Envelopes: get or a similar method; that could break the DocuSign rule against polling.\\\\n\\\\nThe URL returned by this method is valid for one use. It must be used/displayed within a couple of minutes after being generated. Once the recipient is redirected to the recipient view, they must interact with the DocuSign system periodically or their session will time out.\\\\n\\\\nBecause the URL is time-limited, it should not be stored or sent via email. Immediately redirect the user's browser to the URL after you receive it.\\\\n\\\\nIf you want to invite someone to an embedded signing session via email, the email invitation's URL must be to your application. When invoked, your app should request a recipientView URL from DocuSign and then redirect the signer to that URL.\\\\n\\\\nAfter the recipient completes the recipient view (or signing ceremony), they are redirected to your application. Your application can recover state information about the transaction by storing information in a cookie, or by including query parameters in the \`returnUrl\` field. Eg, \`https://myapp.eg.com/docusign_return?myState=12345\` When the user is redirected to your app, the \`event\` query parameter will be appended. In this example, prevent spoofing by not using a guessable value as the state value.\\"

  email: String
  emailNotification: recipientEmailNotification_Input
  \\"Specifies a sender provided valid URL string for redirecting an embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. \\\\n\\\\nIf set to \`SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN\`, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation that is launched by any partner.\\\\n\\\\nIt is important to remember that in a typical embedded workflow the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application, DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own process for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process in initiated. However, when the sending application sets \`EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN\`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of the recipient.\\\\n\\\\nIf the \`clientUserId\` property is NOT set, and the \`embeddedRecipientStartURL\` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: envelopeId, recipientId, recipientName, recipientEmail, and customFields. The \`customFields\` property must be set fort the recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double brackets. \\\\n\\\\n*Example*: \\\\n\\\\n\`http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession? [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]\`\\"

When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. \\\\n\\\\nIf set to \`SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN\`, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation that is launched by any partner.\\\\n\\\\nIt is important to remember that in a typical embedded workflow the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application, DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own process for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process in initiated. However, when the sending application sets \`EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN\`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of the recipient.\\\\n\\\\nIf the \`clientUserId\` property is NOT set, and the \`embeddedRecipientStartURL\` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient.
