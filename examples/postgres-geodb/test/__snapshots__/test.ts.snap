The root subscription type: contains events and live queries you can subscribe to with the \`subscription\` operation.

#### Live Queries

Live query fields are differentiated by containing \`(live)\` at the end of their
description, they are added for each field in the \`Query\` type. When you
subscribe to a live query field, the selection set will be evaluated and sent to
the client, and then most things\\\\* that would cause the output of the selection
set to change will trigger the selection set to be re-evaluated and the results
to be re-sent to the client.

_(\\\\* Not everything: typically only changes to persisted data referenced by the query are detected, not computed fields.)_

Live queries can be very expensive, so try and keep them small and focussed.

#### Events

Event fields will run their selection set when, and only when, the specified
server-side event occurs. This makes them a lot more efficient than Live
Queries, but it is still recommended that you keep payloads fairly small.
