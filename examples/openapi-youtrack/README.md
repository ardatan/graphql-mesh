This example takes YouTrack as API Source and generates GraphQL Schema

You should have a YouTrack instance and a valid token.

See here; https://www.jetbrains.com/help/youtrack/standalone/Manage-Permanent-Token.html#obtain-permanent-token

You need to pass two environmental variables to run this project with the command `yarn start`;

- `YOUTRACK_SERVICE_URL` is your YouTrack service URL. If you are using the cloud, you have a URL something like this; `https://ardatan.myjetbrains.com/youtrack`
- `YOUTRACK_TOKEN` is your YouTrack token to access YouTrack service using REST API. If it is a permenant token, it should be something like `perm:XXXXXX==XXXXXXX==XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`

Then run this project with the following command;

```sh
YOUTRACK_SERVICE_URL={YOUR_API_URL_HERE} YOUTRACK_TOKEN={YOUR TOKEN IS HERE} yarn start
```
