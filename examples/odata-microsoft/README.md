# GraphQL Mesh for Microsoft Graph

**Note:** This project is based on [Microsoft's GraphQL for Microsoft Graph Demo](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/graphql-demo)

## About
This is a *demo* that enables basic, read-only querying of the [Microsoft Graph API](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/) using [GraphQL query syntax](http://graphql.org/learn/queries/). GraphQL enables clients to request exactly the resources and properties that they need instead of making REST requests for each resource and consolidating the responses. To create a GraphQL service, this demo translates the [Microsoft Graph OData $metadata document](https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata) to a GraphQL schema and generates the necessary resolvers. Please note we are providing this demo code for evaluation as-is.
