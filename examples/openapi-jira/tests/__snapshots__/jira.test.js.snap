In Jira Cloud, the list of project roles is shared globally with all projects, but each project can have a different set of actors associated with it (unlike groups, which have the same membership throughout all Jira applications).\\\\n\\\\nProject roles are used in [permission schemes](#api-rest-api-3-permissionscheme-get), [email notification schemes](#api-rest-api-3-notificationscheme-get), [issue security levels](#api-rest-api-3-issuesecurityschemes-get), [comment visibility](#api-rest-api-3-comment-list-post), and workflow conditions.\\\\n\\\\n#### Members and actors ####\\\\n\\\\nIn the Jira REST API, a member of a project role is called an *actor*. An *actor* is a group or user associated with a project role.\\\\n\\\\nActors may be set as [default members](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/3odKLg#Managingprojectroles-Specifying'defaultmembers'foraprojectrole) of the project role or set at the project level:\\\\n\\\\n *  Default actors: Users and groups that are assigned to the project role for all newly created projects. The default actors can be removed at the project level later if desired.\\\\n *  Actors: Users and groups that are associated with a project role for a project, which may differ from the default actors.
