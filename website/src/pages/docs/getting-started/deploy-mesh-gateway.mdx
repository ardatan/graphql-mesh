# How to: Deploy a GraphQL Mesh Gateway

Thanks to its flexible architecture and embedded server relying on [GraphQL Yoga](https://graphql-yoga.com) and [Envelop](https://envelop.dev), **GraphQL Mesh can be deployed anywhere**!

We already saw that `mesh dev` could be used for local development.

Similarly, Mesh provides a `mesh start` CLI command for production environments.

`mesh start` can be used for all environments supporting starting a webserver (Heroku, Digital Ocean, etc).

Setup Mesh on a Serverless environment requires some integration work, detailed below.

## Deploy Mesh with `mesh start`

While `mesh dev` handles the generation of the SDK code, `mesh start` expects to load the Gateway schema and runtime from the `.mesh/` folder.

This mechanism helps:

- **reducing the start time of the server**: no build step is required
- **preventing starting failure if one of the Sources is unreachable**: we don't fetch the API definition file at startup, ensuring that the fetched definitions are validated at build time

To deploy a Mesh Gateway, you need to ensure that `mesh build` is called during the deployment, for example, with a `prebuild` step:

```jsonc filename="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "mesh start",
    // will be run during deployment
    "prebuild": "mesh build"
  }
}
```

For more information about the embedded Mesh server configuration, please [refer to the `serve` reference documentation](/docs/getting-started/customize-mesh-server#configuration-serve-reference).

## Deploy Mesh on Serverless

Serverless deployment requires some integration since we cannot keep the `mesh start` server running.

### Deploy Mesh on Vercel with Next.js API Routes

First, let's ensure that `mesh build` will be run during deployment.

Vercel - list most platforms, and run `yarn build` for deployment.
For this reason, we will add a `prebuild` step:

```jsonc filename="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "mesh start",
    // will be run during deployment
    "prebuild": "mesh build"
  }
}
```

Now, let's integrate our Mesh Gateway in a Next.js API Routes:

```ts filename="website/src/pages/api/graphql/index.ts"
import { createBuiltMeshHTTPHandler } from './.mesh'

export default createBuiltMeshHTTPHandler()
```

A complete example is found at [website/src/pages/api/covid/index.ts](https://github.com/Urigo/graphql-mesh/blob/master/website/src/pages/api/covid/index.ts).

### Deploy Mesh on AWS Lambda

Similarly to regular and Vercel deployment, we will need to add the `mesh build` command in the build step.

Then, we can create a Lambda as it follows:

```ts filename="graphql.ts"
import type { Handler } from '@aws-cdk/aws-lambda'
import { configure } from '@vendia/serverless-express'
import { createBuiltMeshHTTPHandler } from './.mesh'

const app = createBuiltMeshHTTPHandler()

export const handler: Handler = configure({
  // Pass Mesh HTTP handler as app
  app,
})
```

### Deploy Mesh on Cloudflare Workers

Similarly to regular and Vercel deployment, we will need to add the `mesh build` command in the build step.

Then:

```ts filename="listener.mjs"
import { createBuiltMeshHTTPHandler } from './.mesh'

// Pass Mesh's HTTP handler as an event listener
self.addEventListener('fetch', createBuiltMeshHTTPHandler())
```

### Mesh as an Express route

Similarly to regular and Vercel deployment, we will need to add the `mesh build` command in the build step.

```ts filename="index.ts"
import { createBuiltMeshHTTPHandler } from './.mesh'

const app = express()
app.use('/my-api', createBuiltMeshHTTPHandler())
```

### Mesh as a Fastify route

Similarly to regular and Vercel deployment, we will need to add the `mesh build` command in the build step.

```ts filename="index.ts"
import { createBuiltMeshHTTPHandler } from './.mesh'

const app = fastify()

const meshHttp = createBuiltMeshHTTPHandler()

app.route({
  url: '/graphql',
  method: ['GET', 'POST', 'OPTIONS'],
  async handler(req, reply) {
    // Second parameter adds Fastify's `req` and `reply` to the GraphQL Context
    const response = await meshHttp.handleNodeRequest(req, {
      req,
      reply,
    })
    response.headers.forEach((value, key) => {
      reply.header(key, value)
    })

    reply.status(response.status)

    reply.send(response.body)

    return reply
  },
})
```

### Mesh as a Node.js request handler

Similarly to regular and Vercel deployment, we will need to add the `mesh build` command in the build step.

```ts filename="index.ts"
import { createBuiltMeshHTTPHandler } from './.mesh'
import { createServer } from 'node:http'

const server = createServer(createBuiltMeshHTTPHandler())
server.listen(4000)
```

### Mesh as a Koa route

Similarly to regular and Vercel deployment, we will need to add the `mesh build` command in the build step.

```ts filename="index.ts"
import { createBuiltMeshHTTPHandler } from './.mesh'

const app = new Koa()

const meshHttp = createBuiltMeshHTTPHandler()
app.use(async (ctx) => {
  // Second parameter adds Koa's context into GraphQL Context
  const response = await meshHttp.handleNodeRequest(ctx.req, ctx)

  // Set status code
  ctx.status = response.status

  // Set headers
  response.headers.forEach((value, key) => {
    ctx.append(key, value)
  })

  // Converts ReadableStream to a NodeJS Stream
  ctx.body = response.body
})
```

### Mesh and Sveltekit

Similarly to regular and Vercel deployment, we will need to add the `mesh build` command in the build step.

```ts filename="index.ts"
import { createBuiltMeshHTTPHandler } from './.mesh'

const meshHttp = createBuiltMeshHTTPHandler()

export {
  meshHttp as get,
  meshHttp as post,
}
```

## Mesh and Docker

A GraphQL Mesh Gateway should be treated like any Node.js project while keeping in mind that a `mesh build` step should be added to the deployment steps.

<Callout>
  Any Node.js Docker image is suitable for GraphQL Mesh deployment:
