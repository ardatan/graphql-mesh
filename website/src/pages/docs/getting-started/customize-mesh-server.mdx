# How to: Customize the Mesh server

GraphQL Mesh provides a **reliable and production-ready server implementation** built with [GraphQL Yoga](https://graphql-yoga.com) and [Envelop](https://envelop.dev) with, out of the box support for:

- Persisted queries
- Live queries
- Files upload
- Serverless deployment
- [and more...](https://graphql-yoga.com/docs/quick-start)

{/* TODO(charly): add links to "persisted queries" and "live queries" */}

Customizing your GraphQL Mesh Gateway server can be achieved in 2 ways:

- **Configure and provide Envelop plugins**: to add behaviors such as caching, authentication, tracing to your Gateway
- **Provide a standalone server implementation**: to completely replace the server used by the Gateway

## Configure and provide Envelop plugins

[Envelop](https://envelop.dev) is a library that helps build GraphQL API faster and flexibly with plugin-based architecture.

Similar to Express middlewares allowing you to customize requests' behavior, Envelop applies the same idea to GraphQL requests.

By exposing hooks in all the phases of a GraphQL Request execution, Envelop enables the creation of plugins that simplify the setup of standard API features such as:

- Security: Depth limits, Rate limiting
- Authentication
- Advanced caching
- Error handling: Sentry, error masking
- Monitoring: Hive
- Logging
- Tracing: NewRelic, Datadog, StatsD, Apollo Tracing

An Envelop plugin is a standalone `npm` package that provides a plugin function that can be used in an Envelop setup to customize a GraphQL API behavior.

Examples of plugins are:

- `useGenericAuth` (`@envelop/generic-auth`): Custom authentication flow by providing a custom user resolver.
- `useDepthLimit` (`@envelop/depth-limit`): Limit the depth of executed selection sets.

The GraphQL Mesh configuration accepts a `additionalEnvelopPlugins` parameter that should point to a file that exports a list of Envelop plugins, as shown below:

```yaml filename=".meshrc.yaml"
sources:
  # â€¦

additionalEnvelopPlugins: './envelopPlugins'
```

```ts filename="envelopPlugins.ts"
import { PluginOrDisabledPlugin } from '@envelop/core'
import { useDepthLimit } from '@envelop/depth-limit'
import { useSentry } from '@envelop/sentry'

const plugins: PluginOrDisabledPlugin = [
  useDepthLimit({
    maxDepth: 10
  }),
  useSentry({
    includeRawResult: false
  })
]

export default plugins
```

<Callout>Note: The file can also export a factory function returning a `PluginOrDisabledPlugin` list</Callout>

## Provide a standalone server implementation

> **Disclaimer:** This section explains how to provide a custom server implementation used by `mesh serve` and `mesh dev`. If you are looking for solutions to **deploy Mesh to Serverless environments** or **not rely on `mesh serve`**, please refer to the ["How to: Deploy a Mesh Gateway"](/docs/getting-started/deploy-mesh-gateway) guide.

The following example shows how to replace GraphQL Mesh's default server implementation with [Apollo Server](https://apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server).

GraphQL Mesh uses [Envelop](https://envelop.dev) under the hood, so you need to check other integrations to see how to use `getEnveloped` with other server frameworks. [Envelop Integrations](https://envelop.dev/docs/integrations)

```ts filename="myServerHandler.ts"
import { ApolloServer } from 'apollo-server'
import type { ServeMeshOptions } from '@graphql-mesh/runtime'

export default async function ({ getBuiltMesh, logger, argsPort }: ServeMeshOptions): Promise<void> {
  const { schema, getEnveloped } = await getBuiltMesh()
  const apolloServer = new ApolloServer({
    schema,
    async executor(requestContext) {
      const { schema, execute, contextFactory } = getEnveloped({ req: requestContext.request.http })

      return execute({
        schema,
        document: requestContext.document,
        contextValue: await contextFactory(),
        variableValues: requestContext.request.variables,
        operationName: requestContext.operationName
      })
    }
  })

  const { url } = await apolloServer.listen(argsPort)
  logger.info(`ðŸš€ Server ready at ${url}`)
}
```

Then add the following line to your configuration file:

```yaml filename=".meshrc.yaml"
serve:
  customServerHandler: ./myServerHandler
```

<Callout>When you use a custom server handler, you won't be able to use configuration options under `serve`!</Callout>
