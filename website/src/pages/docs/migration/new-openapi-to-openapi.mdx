# new-openAPI handler renamed openAPI

After a period of development the new-openAPI handler (v0.8.2) was merged with the openAPI handler
(v0.32.0), effectively replacing it.

<Callout>
  Note: If you migrate from new-openAPI handler prior to v0.8.2 or to openAPI handler later than
  v0.32.0, some additional steps might be required.
</Callout>

`"@graphql-mesh/openapi": "0.32.0"`.
