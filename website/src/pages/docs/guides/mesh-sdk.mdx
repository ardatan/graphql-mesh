# Generating fully type safe SDK

You can use GraphQL Mesh as a completely type-safe SDK in your existing TypeScript project.

Instead of using GraphQL operations as string with `execute` - you can use GraphQL Mesh and generate a ready-to-use TypeScript SDK to fetch your data. It will make sure to have type-safety and auto-complete for variables and returned data.

## Getting started

### 1. Create or move your GraphQL operations to `.graphql` files

Create your own GraphQL operations in a `.graphql` file for your SDK, for example:

```graphql
query myQuery($someVar: String!) {
  getSomething(var: $someVar) {
    fieldA
    fieldB
  }
}
```

### 2. Update your `.meshrc.yml` configuration

Now, update your `.meshrc.yml` to include this GraphQL document, as follows:

```yaml filename=".meshrc.yml"
sources: # â€¦

documents:
  - ./src/**/*.graphql

sdk:
  generateOperations:
    selectionSetDepth: 2 # This is the maximum level of selection set
```

### 3. Build your SDK with Mesh artifacts

This will generate an SDK inside your Mesh artifacts under `.mesh` directory;

```sh
yarn mesh build
```

### 4. Use the generated SDK in the code

Now, instead of using `execute` manually, you can use the generated `getSdk` method with your GraphQL Mesh client, and use the functions that are generated based on your operations:

```ts
import { getMeshSDK } from './.mesh'

async function test() {
  // Load mesh config and get the sdkClient from it
  const sdk = getMeshSDK()

  // Execute `myQuery` and get a type-safe result
  // Variables and result are typed: { getSomething: { fieldA: string, fieldB: number }, errors?: GraphQLError[] }
  const { getSomething } = await sdk.myQuery({ someVar: 'foo' })
}
```

## Configuring SDK Generation

GraphQL Mesh CLI uses [GraphQL Code Generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com) and its [Generic SDK plugin](https://graphql-code-generator.com/plugins/typescript-generic-sdk) to generate a fully typed SDK from your unified schema. It is possible to configure it to get more customized experience.
