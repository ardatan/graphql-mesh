  Learn how to use dynamic values in GraphQL Mesh configuration setup with env and runtime
  variables, including operation-specific and globally available variables.

# Using Dynamic Variables for Configuration

Mesh enables usage of dynamic values in the configuration setup. Usage is done with curly braces,
e.g. `{context.headers['x-my-api-token']}`.

## `env` variables

All variables available on your env could be used as configuration variables. For example, setting a
base URL could be done as follows:

```yaml filename=".meshrc.yaml"
sources:
  - name: MyGraphQLApi
    handler:
      graphql:
        endpoint: {env.BASE_URL}/graphql
```

## Runtime variables

In addition to environment variables, Mesh also supports runtime variables. These variables can be
devided into two groups:

### Operation Specific

Those are variables that are available only for a specific operation:

#### 'args' Variables

Enables usage of operation arguments as variables. In the following example we define an argument
for the `subreddit` field and use it in the `path` of the operation:

```yaml filename=".meshrc.yaml"
  ...
      jsonSchema:
        baseUrl: https://www.reddit.com/
        operations:
          - type: Query
            field: subreddit
            path: /r/{args.subreddit}.json
            method: GET
            responseSample: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit.json
            responseTypeName: Subreddit
            argTypeMap:
              subreddit:
                type: string
```

#### 'root' variables

Enables usage of the root entity as a variable. For a reference, you can see the
[federation example](https://github.com/Urigo/graphql-mesh/blob/master/examples/federation-example/gateway/.meshrc.yml#L16),
using the `user.id` as a variable.

### Runtime Globally

This variables are available for all operations:

#### 'context' variable

Enables usage of the Mesh runtime context as a variable. If Mesh runs as a gateway, the `context`
variable will contain the `headers` and `cookies` of the request. If Mesh runs as a standalone
server, the `context` variable will contain the `headers` and `cookies` of the request, as well as
the `req` and `res` objects.

In the following example we use the `accessToken` cookie as an auth token:

```yaml filename=".meshrc.yaml"
sources:
  - name: Microsoft Graph
    handler:
      odata:
        endpoint: https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/
        batch: json
        operationHeaders:
          Authorization: Bearer {context.cookies.accessToken}
```

If Mesh is initialized with a `context` object, it will be available as a variable as well. Other
than that, some handler-dependent `context` properties might be available.
