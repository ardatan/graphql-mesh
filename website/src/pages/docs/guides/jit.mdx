# Just-In-Time Compilation

GraphQL JIT is technique in the GraphQL execution that improves the performance of GraphQL Mesh by
compiling the operations. by compiling to JS, V8 is able to create optimized code which yields much
better performance. graphql-jit leverages this behaviour of V8 optimization by compiling the queries
into functions to significantly improve performance
[See benchmarks](https://github.com/zalando-incubator/graphql-jit?tab=readme-ov-file#benchmarks)

## Usage

In order to enable JIT compilation, you need to add `jitEnabled` flag to your configuration:

```yaml filename=".meshrc.yaml"
sources:
  # ...
jitEnabled: true
```
