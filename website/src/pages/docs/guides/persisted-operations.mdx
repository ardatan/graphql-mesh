# Persisted Operations

Persisted operations is a mechanism for preventing the execution of arbitrary GraphQL operation
documents. By default, the persisted operations plugin follows the
[the APQ Specification](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-link-persisted-queries#apollo-engine)
for **SENDING** hashes to the server.

You have to define your operations in your configuration file like below;

```yml
documents: ./documents/*.graphql
```

Then GraphQL Mesh will generate a persisted operations map under `.mesh` artifacts as
`persisted_operations.json` like below;

```json
{
  "ecf4edb46db40b5132295c0291d62fb65d6759a9eedfa4d5d612dd5ec54a6b38": "{__typename}"
}
```

So you can use this file as a reference for your persisted operations in the client side.

## Testing Persisted Operations

Create an example GraphQL operation;

```graphql filename="test.graphql"
query Test {
  __typename
}
```

And assume that you have the following configuration file;

```yml filename=".meshrc.yml"
documents: ./test.graphql
```

Then GraphQL Mesh will generate `.mesh/persisted_operations.json`;

```json filename=".mesh/persisted_operations.json"
{
  "ecf4edb46db40b5132295c0291d62fb65d6759a9eedfa4d5d612dd5ec54a6b38": "query Test {\n  __typename\n}"
}
```

Start your GraphQL Mesh server and send the following request to the server;

```bash filename="Execute persisted GraphQL operation"
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://localhost:4000/graphql \
  -d '{"extensions":{"persistedQuery":{"version":1,"sha256Hash":"ecf4edb46db40b5132295c0291d62fb65d6759a9eedfa4d5d612dd5ec54a6b38"}}}'

{"data":{"__typename":"Query"}}
```
