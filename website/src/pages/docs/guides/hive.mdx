# GraphQL Hive Integration

GraphQL Hive is a schema registry, monitoring and analytics tool for your GraphQL API, and it is
possible to integrate your GraphQL Mesh application to GraphQL Hive by using the dedicated plugins
and transforms.

## Track your Gateway

You can connect your GraphQL Mesh gateway to GraphQL Hive to GraphQL Hive registry to track changes
on the unified schema and monitor the operations done by the clients.

<PackageCmd packages={['@graphql-mesh/plugin-hive']} />

```yaml filename=".meshrc.yaml"
plugins:
  - hive:
      token: '{env.HIVE_TOKEN}'
```

<Callout>You have to create a project on GraphQL Hive and get an access token</Callout>

## Publish and check the gateway schema

Everytime you build GraphQL Mesh gateway, you can find human-readable SDL version of your schema
under `.mesh/schema.graphql`. You can configure your CI to publish and check your schema
automatically by using Hive CLI.

[Learn more about managing the schema using GraphQL Hive CLI](https://docs.graphql-hive.com/features/publish-schema#using-hive-cli)

## Track your sources

GraphQL Mesh creates GraphQL APIs from non GraphQL APIs, and it is still possible to register these
to GraphQL Hive as a regular GraphQL API. GraphQL Hive transform hooks into the delegation phase to
track operations done to the upstream APIs.

<PackageCmd packages={['@graphql-mesh/transform-hive']} />

```yaml filename=".meshrc.yaml"
sources:
  - name: FooService
    handler:
      openapi:
        source: ./openapi.json
    transforms:
      - hive:
          token: '{env.MYOAS_HIVE_TOKEN}'
```

## Publish the source schema seperately then consume it in the gateway

Let's say you have different repos on each service and you want to publish the schema on these
repos, and keep the configuration for these services there. And the gateway will consume these
schemas and merge them together.

### Step 1: Create a project for the service

Create a project for the service, and get an active token for this gateway.

[Learn more about getting tokens from Hive](https://docs.graphql-hive.com/features/tokens)

### Step 2: Setup Mesh CLI on the service repo

Let's say you have an OpenAPI service on that repo then install the following packages in this case;

```bash
yarn add @graphql-mesh/cli @graphql-mesh/openapi graphql
```

Then configure the source in `.meshrc.yml` file;

```yaml
sources:
  - name: FooService
    handler:
      openapi:
        source: ./openapi.yml
```

### Step 3: Publish the service schema

You need to install GraphQL Hive CLI and configure it with the token you already created before.

[See how to install Hive CLI](https://docs.graphql-hive.com/features/publish-schema#using-hive-cli)

Then you need to run `mesh build` like you do on the gateway to generate the schema, so GraphQL Hive
CLI can publish it.

Finally, you can publish the schema `hive schema:publish .mesh/sources/FooService/schema.graphql`

### Step 4: Create Hive CDN URL and token for the service

Go to the service project and click `Connect` on the right top of the page. Copy the URL and header
then paste it to the `.meshrc.yml` file.

```yaml
sources:
  - name: FooService
    handler:
      openapi:
        # URL needs to have `.graphql` extension to tell the handler it is a GraphQL Schema
        source: https://cdn.graphql-hive.com/SOME_UUID?ext=.graphql
        schemaHeaders:
          X-Hive-CDN-Key: SOME_BASE64
```

<Callout>
  If `source` gets a GraphQL Schema for non GraphQL handlers, it doesn't generate the schema again.
  It just reuses it, and adds execution logic only.
</Callout>
