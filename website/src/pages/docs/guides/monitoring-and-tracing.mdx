# Monitoring and Tracing

If something is not working as it should within your GraphQL gateway, you would not want it to go unnoticed.

You can use GraphQL Mesh plugins to trace and monitor your gateway's execution flow together with all outgoing HTTP calls and internal query planning.

> GraphQL Mesh plugins are mostly the extended versions of [the existing Envelop plugins.](https://www.envelop.dev/docs/guides/monitoring-and-tracing)
