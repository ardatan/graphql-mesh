# Monitoring and Tracing

If something is not working as it should within your GraphQL gateway, you would not want it to go unnoticed.

You can use GraphQL Mesh plugins to trace and monitor your gateway's execution flow together with all outgoing HTTP calls and internal query planning.

> GraphQL Mesh plugins are mostly the extended versions of [the existing Envelop plugins.](https://www.envelop.dev/docs/guides/monitoring-and-tracing)

## Mesh plugins

- **StatsD**: collect and send metrics to Datadog's DogStatsD and InfluxDB's Telegraf StatsD services. [Read more](/docs/plugins/statsd)
- **Prometheus**: expose and collect metrics to Prometheus. [Read more](/docs/plugins/prometheus)
- **NewRelic**: tracing, monitoring and error reporting with NewRelic. [Read more](/docs/plugins/new-relic)


## GraphQL Result Extensions

You can expose the details of outgoing HTTP requests done by GraphQL Mesh source handlers within `extensions` property of the GraphQL execution.

### Getting Started

```yaml
# .meshrc.yml
# You need to enable this flag to expose the details in the extensions.
includeHttpDetailsInExtensions: true
```

Then you get the results like below;
```json
{
  "data": {
    "someData": "someResult"
  },
  "extensions": {
    "httpDetails": [
      {
        "sourceName": "MySource",
        "path": {
          "key": "sourceFieldName"
        },
        "request": {
          "timestamp": "2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
          "url": "http://localhost:8080/some-external-service/some-path",
          "method": "GET",
          "headers": {
            "Accept": "application/json",
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
          },
        },
        "response": {
          "timestamp": "2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
          "status": 200,
          "statusText": "OK",
          "headers": {
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
          },
        },
        "responseTime": 9999,
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
