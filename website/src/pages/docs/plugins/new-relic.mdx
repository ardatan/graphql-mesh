# NewRelic

If you wish to integrate NewRelic for tracing, monitoring and error reporting, you can use
`@graphql-mesh/plugin-newrelic`.

You can instrument your GraphQL application with New Relic reporting in order to take advantage of
Distributed tracing to monitor performance and errors whilst ultimately getting to the root cause of
issues.

## Getting Started

<PackageCmd packages={['@graphql-mesh/plugin-newrelic', 'newrelic']} />

### Enabling required NewRelic feature flags

Some additional configuration is needed to allow Mesh send the collected information correctly to
NewRelic.

You can add the following to your `.env` file;

```shell filename=".env"
NEW_RELIC_FEATURE_FLAG_UNDICI_INSTRUMENTATION=true
NEW_RELIC_FEATURE_FLAG_UNDICI_ASYNC_TRACKING=true
NEW_RELIC_FEATURE_FLAG_NEW_PROMISE_TRACKING=true
```

or you can add the following to your NewRelic configuration file `newrelic.ts`;

```ts filename="newrelic.ts"
exports.config = {
  // ...
  feature_flag: {
    undici_instrumentation: true,
    undici_async_tracking: true,
    new_promise_tracking: true
  }
}
```

## Example Configuration

```yaml filename=".meshrc.yaml"
# ...
plugins:
  - newrelic:
      # default `false`. When set to `true`, includes the GraphQL document defining the operations and fragments
      includeDocument: true
      # default `false`. When set to `true`, includes all the operation variables with their values
      includeExecuteVariables: false
      # default: `false`. When set to `true`, includes the execution result
      includeRawResult: false
      # default `false`. When set to `true`, track resolvers as segments to monitor their performance
      trackResolvers: true
      # default `false`. When set to `true`, includes all the arguments passed to resolvers with their values
      includeResolverArgs: false
      # default `false`. When set to `true` append the names of operation root fields to the transaction name
      rootFieldsNaming: true
      # Allows to set a custom operation name to be used as transaction name and attribute
      extractOperationName: "{context.headers['x-operation-name']}"
```
