# Block Field Suggestions

If you disabled schema introspection, you should also disable field suggestions as these allow
reverse-engineering a GraphQL schema.

## Getting Started

Install the plugin first;

<PackageCmd packages={['@escape.tech/graphql-armor-block-field-suggestions']} />

Then configure it in your `.meshrc.yml` file.

```yaml
plugins:
  - blockFieldSuggestions: {}
```
