# Caching in HTTP

Usually server environments don't have browser's HTTP caching logic.
This plugin brings [HTTP Caching](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Caching) to your GraphQL Mesh gateway.

<Callout>
  The defined cache storage will be used for this plugin. By default, GraphQL Mesh uses [Localforage](/docs/cache/localforage) as a cache storage.
  For example, you need to follow this section to configure [Redis](/docs/cache/redis) as your cache storage.
  You can find other options under the same category.
</Callout>

## Getting Started

<PackageCmd packages={['@graphql-mesh/plugin-http-cache']} />

Then add the plugin to your configuration;

```yaml filename=".meshrc.yaml"
plugins:
  httpCache: {}
```
