# GraphQL Response Caching

*GraphQL Response Caching* is a feature that allows you to cache the response of a GraphQL query. This is useful when you want to reduce the number of requests to your sources. For example, if you have a GraphQL query that fetches a list of products, you can cache the response of this query so that the next time the same query is made, the response is fetched from the cache instead of making a request to the underlying sources.

GraphQL Mesh's Response Cache Plugin uses [Envelop's Response Caching](https://www.envelop.dev/docs/guides/adding-a-graphql-response-cache) under the hood.

You can [learn more on Envelop's docs](https://www.envelop.dev/docs/guides/adding-a-graphql-response-cache).

<Callout>
  The defined cache storage will be used for this plugin. By default, GraphQL Mesh uses [Localforage](/docs/cache/localforage) as a cache storage.
  For example, you need to follow this section to configure [Redis](/docs/cache/redis) as your cache storage.
  You can find other options under the same category.

## Getting Started

<PackageCmd packages={['@graphql-mesh/plugin-response-cache']} />

Then add the plugin to your configuration;

```yaml filename=".meshrc.yaml"
# ...
plugins:
  - responseCache: {}
```

The caching behavior can be fully customized. A TTL can be provided global or more granular per type or schema coordinate.

```yaml filename=".meshrc.yaml"
# ...
plugins:
  - responseCache:
      # cache operations for 1 hour by default
      ttl: 60 * 1000 + 60,
      ttlPerCoordinate:
        # cache operation containing Stock object type for 500ms
        - coordinate: Stock
          ttl: 500
        # cache operation containing Query.rocketCoordinates selection for 100ms
        - coordinate: Query.rocketCoordinates
          ttl: 100
      ignoredTypes:
        # never cache responses that include a RefreshToken object type
        - RefreshToken
```

If you need to cache based on the user;

```yaml filename=".meshrc.yaml"
# ...
plugins:
  - responseCache:
      if: "context.headers.authorization != null"
      session: "{context.headers.authorization}"
```

If you don't want to invalidate automatically based on mutations;

```yaml filename=".meshrc.yaml"
# ...
plugins:
  - responseCache:
      invalidateViaMutation: false
```

You can check the ["Location Weather" example](https://github.com/Urigo/graphql-mesh/tree/master/examples/openapi-location-weather/) that uses OpenAPI handler with cache transform;
