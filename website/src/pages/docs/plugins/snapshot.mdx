# Snapshot Plugin

The `snapshot` plugin allows applying snapshot for development usage.

The snapshot plugin writes the responses of your remote data source to your file system and then uses it instead of re-fetching it every time. It's also helpful because you can easily manipulate your data manually and see how your API mesh responds.

To get started with this plugin, install it:

<PackageCmd packages={['@graphql-mesh/plugin-snapshot']} />

## How to use?

Add the following configuration to your Mesh config file:

```yaml filename=".meshrc.yaml"
plugins:
  - snapshot:
      if: "process.env.NODE_ENV != 'production'"
      apply:
        - https://my-remote-api.com/*
      outputDir: __snapshots__
```

The following snapshot will work if you are in a development environment (see the `if` command).

To modify your snapshots and change the responses, go to `__snapshots__` and modify the responses under those files.

## Codesandbox Example
