# LocalForage

LocalForage is a library that improves the existing storage mechanism in the browser by using `IndexedDB`, `WebSQL` and `localStorage`, [see more](https://github.com/localForage/localForage).

This caching mechanism is only recommended for the browser environments, [see the example](https://github.com/Urigo/graphql-mesh/blob/master/examples/openapi-react-weatherbit/src/mesh/useMeshSdk.ts#L10).

To get started with this caching strategy, install it:

<PackageCmd packages={['@graphql-mesh/cache-localforage']} />

## How to use?

```yaml
cache:
  localforage:
    driver: [WEBSQL, INDEXEDDB, LOCALSTORAGE] # LocalForage will try these methods in order and get the first compatible option
```
