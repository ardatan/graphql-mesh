# CloudFlare Workers KV

If you are using Mesh on Cloudflare Workers, you can use [*KV*](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/kv/) as a storage.

To get started with this caching strategy, install it:

<PackageCmd packages={['@graphql-mesh/cache-cfkw']} />

## How to use?

```yaml
cache:
  file:
    namespace: MY_MESH_CACHE
```
