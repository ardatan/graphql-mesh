# OpenAPI / Swagger

This handler allows you to load remote or local [OpenAPI (2/3) and Swagger](https://swagger.io) schemas.

For migrationg from version `< 0.32` see [migration guide](/docs/migration/openapi-0.31-0.32)

You can import it using remote/local `.json` or `.yaml`.

To get started, install the handler library:

<PackageCmd packages={['@graphql-mesh/openapi']} />

Now, you can use it directly in your Mesh config file / URL:

```yaml
sources:
  - name: MyOpenapiApi
    handler:
      openapi:
        source: ./my-schema.json
```

Note that this handler is based on the [JSON Schema handler](/docs/handlers/json-schema) - so it's configurations will apply here as well.

## Overriding default Query/Mutation operations classification

By default, all GET operations will be placed into Query fields and all other operations into Mutation fields. with this option, you can manually override this process.
To switch between Query and Mutation operations, and vice versa, you need to define a rule per override, consisting of the OAS title, the path of the operation, the method of the operation and finally, the destination type (e.g., Query or Mutation).
See the example below:

```yaml
sources:
  - name: MyOpenapiApi
    handler:
      openapi:
        source: ./my-schema.json
        selectQueryOrMutationField:
          - fieldName: 'add_weather_forecast' # OAS field name
            type: Query # switch method POST from default Mutation into Query
          - fieldName: 'get_weather_forecast' # OAS field name
            type: Mutation # switch method GET from default Query into Mutation
```

## Naming convention

We use `operationId` for the names, and aim to keep it as close as possible to origin.

### Type naming

We adjust `operationId` only when necessary according to the GraphQL spec:
    - Chars  ` ` (white space), `.`, `/` and `-` are replaced with `_` (underscore)
    - Other chars which are not latin/digits are replaced with their char codes
    - If first char of the name is a digit, we prefix it with `_` (GraphQL spec doesnâ€™t allow that)

### Unnamed types

We use path-based naming. So names could be structured like, for example, `query_getUsers_items_firstName`

## Dynamic Header Values

Mesh can take dynamic values from the GraphQL Context or the environmental variables. For example, if you use `mesh dev` or `mesh start`, GraphQL Context will be the incoming HTTP request.

The expression inside dynamic values should be as in JS.

### From Context (HTTP Header for `mesh dev` or `mesh start`)

```yaml
sources:
  - name: MyGraphQLApi
    handler:
      openapi:
        source: ./my-schema.json
        operationHeaders:
          # Please do not use capital letters while getting the headers
          Authorization: Bearer {context.headers['x-my-api-token']}
          # You can also access to the cookies like below;
          # Authorization: Bearer {context.cookies.myApiToken}
```

And for `mesh dev` or `mesh start`, you can pass the value using `x-my-graphql-api-token` HTTP header.

### From Environmental Variable

`MY_API_TOKEN` is the name of the environmental variable you have the value.

```yaml {7}
sources:
  - name: MyGraphQLApi
    handler:
      openapi:
        source: ./my-schema.json
        operationHeaders:
          Authorization: Bearer {env.MY_API_TOKEN}
```

## Advanced cookies handling

When building a web application, cookies are often used for authentication for security reasons. On the other end, mobile applications tend to use an HTTP header.

This section shows how to configure GraphQL Mesh to accept either and use GraphQL Mesh to set/unset cookies on the login & logout mutations.

### Accepting one of the cookies, header, or context value

We want to accept one of the following:

- an `accessToken` cookie
- an `Authorization` header
- an authorization value available in context (e.g. set by a GraphQL auth plugin)

And transmit it to the Rest API as an `Authorization` header. GraphQL Mesh does not allow dynamic selection in the `meshrc.yaml` file, but that's fine! We can use a bit of trickery.

```yaml
sources:
  - name: Rest
    handler:
      openapi:
        source: ./openapi.yaml
        baseUrl: '{env.REST_URL}/api/'
        operationHeaders:
          Authorization-Header: '{context.headers.authorization}'
          Authorization-Cookie: Bearer {context.cookies.accessToken}

# You can provide a custom fetch function to override the default fetch function
customFetch: ./src/custom-fetch.js
```

Here in the `meshrc.yaml` configuration we store the cookie in `Authorization-Cookie`, and the header in `Authorization-Header`. To introduce the logic needed to generate the proper `Authorization` header for the Rest API, we need to implement a `customFetch`. It will replace the `fetch` used by GraphQL Mesh to call the Rest API.

```js
import { MeshContext } from '@graphql-mesh/types';
import { fetch } from '@whatwg-node/fetch';

export default(url: string, init: RequestInit, context: MeshContext) {
  // Set Authorization header dynamically to context value, or input cookie, or input header
  args.headers['authorization'] =
    context.authorization || args.headers['authorization-cookie'] || args.headers['authorization-header']
  // Clean up headers forwarded to the Rest API
  delete args.headers['authorization-cookie']
  delete args.headers['authorization-header']
  // Execute the fetch with the new headers
  return fetch(url, args)
}
```



### Setting / Unsetting the cookie

Of course, using GraphQL Mesh as a Gateway for both the mobile application and web application is excellent. Still, there's one thing missing: the setting of the cookie for the web application.

We need to access the HTTP response that is sent back to the client. Luckily, we can do so in `additionalResolvers`. So we need to create two new resolvers, one for login and one for logout, and manage the cookie in their code.

The first step is to edit the `meshrc.yaml` file, add this at the end:

```yaml filename="meshrc.yaml"
additionalTypeDefs: |
  extend type Mutation {
    login(credentials: Credentials!): String
    logout: Boolean
  }
additionalResolvers:
  - ./src/additional-resolvers.js
```

Then manage the cookie in the new resolvers:

```js
// lifespan of our cookie
const oneYear = 365 * 24 * 3600

const resolvers = {
  Mutation: {
    async login(root, args, context, info) {
      // Call the Rest API's login operation
      const result = await context.Rest.Mutation.accountLogin({
        root,
        args: {
          credentials: args.credentials
        },
        context,
        info
      })
      // if `result` contains a JWT token, you could instead decode it and set `Expires`
      // to the JWT token's expiration date
      context.res.set('Set-Cookie', `accessToken=${result}; Path=/; Secure; HttpOnly; Max-Age=${oneYear};`)

      return result
    },
    logout(root, args, { res }) {
      // use old date to unset cookie
      res.set('Set-Cookie', `accessToken=logout; Path=/; Secure; HttpOnly; Expires=Thu, 1 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT;`)

      return true
    }
  }
}

module.exports = { resolvers }
```

## Callbacks as Subscriptions

OpenAPI handler is able to process OAS Callbacks as GraphQL Subscriptions. It uses your PubSub implementation to consume the data. But you have to define webhooks for individual callbacks to make it work.

See [Subscriptions & Webhooks](../subscriptions-webhooks.md) to create an endpoint to consume a webhook. You should use the callback url as `pubSubTopic` in the webhook configuration.

Also see our example; [Subscriptions Example with Webhooks](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/Urigo/graphql-mesh/tree/master/examples/openapi-subscriptions).
