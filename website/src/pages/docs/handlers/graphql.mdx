This handler allows you to load remote GraphQL schemas and use them with schema-stitching based on `graphql-tools`.

To get started, install the handler library:

<PackageCmd packages={['@graphql-mesh/graphql']} />

Now, you can use it directly in your Mesh config file:

```yaml
sources:
  - name: MyGraphQLApi
    handler:
      graphql:
        endpoint: http://my-service-url:3000/graphql
```

<Callout>
  You can check out our example that uses schema stitching with a PostgreSQL data source.

## Dynamic Header Values (e.g., for Authorization)

Mesh can take dynamic values from the GraphQL Context or the environmental variables. For example, if you use `mesh dev` or `mesh start`, GraphQL Context will be the incoming HTTP request.

The expression inside dynamic values should be as in JS.

### From Context (HTTP Header for `mesh dev` or `mesh start`)

```yaml
sources:
  - name: MyGraphQLApi
    handler:
      graphql:
        endpoint: http://my-service-url:3000/graphql
        operationHeaders:
          # Please do not use capital letters while getting the headers
          # Use "{context.headers['x-my-api-token']}" if you want just the value of the header
          Authorization: Bearer {context.headers['x-my-api-token']}
          # You can also access to the cookies like below;
          # Authorization: Bearer {context.cookies.myApiToken}
```

And for `mesh dev` or `mesh start`, you can pass the value using `x-my-graphql-api-token` HTTP header.

### From Environment Variables

`MY_API_TOKEN` is the name of the environment variable you have the value.

```yaml {7}
sources:
  - name: MyGraphQLApi
    handler:
      graphql:
        endpoint: http://my-service-url:3000/graphql
        operationHeaders:
          Authorization: Bearer {env.MY_API_TOKEN}
```

## Local Schemas

We recommend providing local schema by using the `additionalTypeDefs` and `additionalResolvers` configuration options.

However, it is also possible to use a local GraphQL Schema instance as a GraphQL Mesh source, as showcased below:

```yaml
sources:
  - name: MyGraphQLApi
    handler:
      graphql:
        schema: ./my-local-schema.ts
```

```ts filename="my-local-schema.ts"
import { makeExecutableSchema } from '@graphql-tools/schema'
export default makeExecutableSchema({
  typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
    type Query {
      foo: String
    }
  `,
  resolvers: {
    Query: {
      foo: () => 'FOO'
    }
  }
})
```

## Fetch Strategies and Multiple HTTP endpoints for the same source

If you want to have an advanced fetch strategy for the GraphQL source such as retrying twice or timeout in 30 seconds etc.
Also, you can have different HTTP endpoints for a single source, and you can configure Mesh to get a better execution flow.

For example, you can make a request to both endpoints and return the fastest response with `race` strategy.

All `fetch` strategies can be combined to create the ultimate execution flow:

<details>
 <summary>`retry`</summary>

The `retry` mechanism allow you to specify the retry attempts for a single GraphQL endpoint/source.

The retry flow will execute in both conditions: a network error, or due to a runtime error.

```yaml {6}
sources:
  - name: uniswapv2
    handler:
      graphql:
        endpoint: https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/uniswap/uniswap-v2
        retry: 2 # specify here, if you have an unstable/error prone indexer
```

</details>

<details>
 <summary>`timeout`</summary>

The `timeout` mechanism allow you to specify the `timeout` for a given GraphQL endpoint.

```yaml {6}
sources:
  - name: uniswapv2
    handler:
      graphql:
        endpoint: https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/uniswap/uniswap-v2
        timeout: 5000 # 5 seconds
```

</details>

<details>
 <summary>`fallback`</summary>

The `fallback` mechanism allow you to specify use more than one GraphQL endpoint, for the same source.

This is helpful if you have a fallback endpoint for the same GraphQL API.

```yaml {5}
sources:
  - name: uniswapv2
    handler:
      graphql:
        strategy: fallback
        sources:
          - endpoint: https://bad-uniswap-v2-api.com
            retry: 2
            timeout: 5000
          - endpoint: https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/uniswap/uniswap-v2
```

</details>

<details>
 <summary>`race`</summary>

The `race` mechanism allow you to specify use more than one GraphQL endpoint, for the same source, and race on every execution.

If you have different places that service is deployed, this is useful to get the fastest response by racing them.

```yaml {5}
sources:
  - name: uniswapv2
    handler:
      graphql:
        strategy: race
        sources:
          - endpoint: https://bad-uniswap-v2-api.com
          - endpoint: https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/uniswap/uniswap-v2
```
