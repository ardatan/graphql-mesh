  GraphQL Mesh is a schema-stitching tool that enables loading remote GraphQL schemas, fetched from
  a CDN or registry, and using them with schema-stitching based on graphql-tools.

This handler allows you to load remote GraphQL schemas and use them with schema-stitching based on
`graphql-tools`.

To get started, install the handler library:

<PackageCmd packages={['@graphql-mesh/graphql']} />

Now, you can use it directly in your Mesh config file:

```yaml filename=".meshrc.yaml"
sources:
  - name: MyGraphQLApi
    handler:
      graphql:
        endpoint: http://my-service-url:3000/graphql
```

<Callout>
  You can check out our example that uses schema stitching with a PostgreSQL data source.

## Fetching SDL or introspection from CDN or any other schema registry tool

Let's say the introspection disabled in your production environment of your GraphQL source, and you
want to provide your SDL or introspection seperately;

```yaml filename=".meshrc.yaml"
sources:
  - name: MyGraphQLApi
    handler:
      graphql:
        endpoint: https://api.github.com/graphql
        # You can provide your SDL or introspection seperately
        source: https://docs.github.com/public/schema.docs.graphql
        operationHeaders:
          Authorization: Bearer {env.GITHUB_TOKEN}
```

> In this case, CLI's `build` command won't save the introspection in the artifacts, so your Mesh
> won't start if `source` URL is down.

### Hive Integration

If you use [GraphQL Hive](https://graphql-hive.com/) to manage your GraphQL APIs as a schema
registry, you can use the following configuration to fetch your schema from Hive:

```yaml filename=".meshrc.yaml"
sources:
  - name: MyGraphQLApi
    handler:
      graphql:
        endpoint: https://my-api.com/graphql
        source: https://cdn.graphql-hive.com/asce7c12-753d-hive-bee-d7f2c803e232/sdl?ext=.graphql
        schemaHeaders:
          X-Hive-CDN-Key: 'aabTxbEyC78NvSPQNO+qLrrRnBvODJJ8k4sL/2EtIwc='
```

## Local Schemas

We recommend providing local schema by using the `additionalTypeDefs` and `additionalResolvers`
configuration options.

However, it is also possible to use a local GraphQL Schema instance as a GraphQL Mesh source, as
showcased below:

```yaml filename=".meshrc.yaml"
sources:
  - name: MyGraphQLApi
    handler:
      graphql:
        source: ./my-local-schema.ts
```

```ts filename="my-local-schema.ts"
import { makeExecutableSchema } from '@graphql-tools/schema'

export default makeExecutableSchema({
  typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
    type Query {
      foo: String
    }
  `,
  resolvers: {
    Query: {
      foo: () => 'FOO'
    }
  }
})
```

## Fetch Strategies and Multiple HTTP endpoints for the same source

If you want to have an advanced fetch strategy for the GraphQL source such as retrying twice or
timeout in 30 seconds etc. Also, you can have different HTTP endpoints for a single source, and you
can configure Mesh to get a better execution flow.

For example, you can make a request to both endpoints and return the fastest response with `race`
strategy.

All `fetch` strategies can be combined to create the ultimate execution flow:

<details>
 <summary>`retry`</summary>

The `retry` mechanism allow you to specify the retry attempts for a single GraphQL endpoint/source.

The retry flow will execute in both conditions: a network error, or due to a runtime error.

```yaml filename=".meshrc.yaml" {6}
sources:
  - name: uniswapv2
    handler:
      graphql:
        endpoint: https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/uniswap/uniswap-v2
        retry: 2 # specify here, if you have an unstable/error prone indexer
```

</details>

<details>
 <summary>`timeout`</summary>

The `timeout` mechanism allow you to specify the `timeout` for a given GraphQL endpoint.

```yaml filename=".meshrc.yaml" {6}
sources:
  - name: uniswapv2
    handler:
      graphql:
        endpoint: https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/uniswap/uniswap-v2
        timeout: 5000 # 5 seconds
```

</details>

<details>
 <summary>`fallback`</summary>

The `fallback` mechanism allow you to specify use more than one GraphQL endpoint, for the same
source.

This is helpful if you have a fallback endpoint for the same GraphQL API.

```yaml filename=".meshrc.yaml" {5}
sources:
  - name: uniswapv2
    handler:
      graphql:
        strategy: fallback
        sources:
          - endpoint: https://bad-uniswap-v2-api.com
            retry: 2
            timeout: 5000
          - endpoint: https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/uniswap/uniswap-v2
```

</details>

<details>
 <summary>`race`</summary>

The `race` mechanism allow you to specify use more than one GraphQL endpoint, for the same source,
and race on every execution.

If you have different places that service is deployed, this is useful to get the fastest response by
racing them.

```yaml filename=".meshrc.yaml" {5}
sources:
  - name: uniswapv2
    handler:
      graphql:
        strategy: race
        sources:
          - endpoint: https://bad-uniswap-v2-api.com
          - endpoint: https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/uniswap/uniswap-v2
```
