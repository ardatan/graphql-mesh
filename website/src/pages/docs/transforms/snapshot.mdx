# Snapshot Transform

The `snapshot` transform allows applying snapshot for development usage.

The snapshot transform writes the responses of your remote data source to your file system and then uses it instead of re-fetching it every time. It's also helpful because you can easily manipulate your data manually and see how your API mesh responds.

To get started with this transform, install it:

<PackageCmd packages={['@graphql-mesh/transform-snapshot']} />

## How to use?

Add the following configuration to your Mesh config file:

```yaml
transforms:
  - snapshot:
      if: "process.env.NODE_ENV != 'production'"
      apply:
        - Query.*
      outputDir: __snapshots__
```

The following snapshot will work if you are in a development environment (see the `if` command).

To modify your snapshots and change the responses, go to `__snapshots__` and modify the responses under those files.

## Codesandbox Example

You can check out our example that uses SOAP Handler with snapshot transform.
