# Naming Convention Transform

The `naming-convention` transforms allow you to apply casing and other conventions to your response.

## Installation

<PackageCmd packages={['@graphql-mesh/transform-naming-convention']} />

## How to use?

<Callout>
  In this example, enumValues fields are converted to uppercase, while fieldNames are converted to
  camel case to enforce consistency.
</Callout>

Add the following configuration to your Mesh config file:

```yaml filename=".meshrc.yaml"
transforms:
  - namingConvention:
      mode: bare | wrap
      typeNames: pascalCase
      enumValues: upperCase
      fieldNames: camelCase
      fieldArgumentNames: camelCase
```

<Callout>
  For information about "bare" and "wrap" modes, please read the [dedicated
  section](/docs/transforms/transforms-introduction#two-different-modes).
</Callout>

<Callout>
  You can see our gRPC example that uses this transform to see its application. [Click here to open
