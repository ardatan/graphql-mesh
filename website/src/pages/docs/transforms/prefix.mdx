  and API reference.

# Prefix Transform

The `prefix` transforms allow you to add prefixes to existing GraphQL types and root operations
(under `Query/Mutation`). `prefix` is similar to [`rename`](/docs/transforms/rename) in that it
allows you to modify names to avoid conflicts, simplify complicated names, and change the appearance
of your query. In contrast with `rename`, `prefix` is simpler and only allows you to append a
`prefix` to the existing name.

You can use it to easily "namespace" APIs in your unified API and avoid conflicts.

## Installation

<PackageCmd packages={['@graphql-mesh/transform-prefix']} />

## How to use?

Add the following configuration to your Mesh config file:

```yaml filename=".meshrc.yaml"
transforms:
  - prefix:
      mode: bare | wrap
      value: MyApi_
```

<Callout>
  For information about "bare" and "wrap" modes, please read the [dedicated section](/docs/transforms/transforms-introduction#two-different-modes).
  You can check out our example that uses schema stitching with a PostgreSQL data source and prefix transform. [Click here to open the example on GitHub](https://github.com/Urigo/graphql-mesh/tree/master/examples/postgres-geodb).
