# Federation Transform

If the original subgraph is not a [federated](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/federation]
subgraph that includes annotations and directives that conform to the Federation specification. You
can use this transform to provide them and convert the subgraph to a federated subgraph.

<Callout>
  If you want to add `@key` directive in your subgraph, you need to be aware of [Type
  Merging](/v1/type-merging)
</Callout>

## How to use?

Let's say you have the following subgraph;

```graphql
type Product {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  price: Float!
}

type Query {
  productById(id: ID!): Product
}
```

And you want to add `@key` directive to the `Product` type. Then you can add the following
configuration to your `mesh.config.ts` file. But you need `resolveReference` to be able to resolve
the reference, which is equivalent of `__resolveReference` resolver in regular Federation.

```ts filename="mesh.config.ts" {13-17}
import {
  createFederationTransform,
  defineConfig,
  loadGraphQLHTTPSubgraph
} from '@graphql-mesh/compose-cli'

export const composeConfig = defineConfig({
  subgraphs: [
    {
      sourceHandler: loadGraphQLHTTPSubgraph('myApi', {
        endpoint: 'http://localhost:4001/my-api'
      }),
      transforms: [
        createFederationTransform({
          // Schema Coordinates
          Product: {
            // Directive name
            key: {
              // Directive arguments
              fields: 'id',
              // Reference resolver (only for @key directive)
              resolveReference: {
                fieldName: 'productById'
              }
            }
          },
          // You can also add other directives
          Query: {
            extends: true
          }
        })
      ]
    }
  ]
})
```
