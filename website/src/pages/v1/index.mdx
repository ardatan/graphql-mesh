# Introduction

GraphQL Mesh is a framework to **build GraphQL Gateways on top of GraphQL and non-GraphQL services**
including REST, gRPC, and more.

You can either compose your sources by using GraphQL Mesh Compose, and then serve it using GraphQL
Mesh Serve, or you can serve your existing unified graph (Federation Supergraph etc) by using
GraphQL Mesh Serve, or you can use GraphQL Mesh Serve as a proxy to your existing GraphQL API by
extending it with additional layer of features such as caching, rate limiting, auth, etc.

**Start with any of the following paths;**

- [Combine GraphQL and non-GraphQL sources with GraphQL Mesh Compose](/v1/compose)
- [Use GraphQL Mesh with your existing Federation Supergraph](/v1/serve)
- [Use GraphQL Mesh with the unified graph composed by GraphQL Mesh Compose](/v1/serve)
- [Use GraphQL Mesh with your existing Federation Supergraph managed by GraphQL Hive](/v1/serve/schema-registry/hive)
- [Use GraphQL Mesh with your existing Federation Supergraph managed by Apollo GraphOS](/v1/serve/schema-registry/hive)
- [Use GraphQL Mesh as a proxy to your existing GraphQL API](/v1/serve#configure-mesh-as-a-graphql-proxy)
