# Introduction

Mesh is a GraphQL composition framework and gateway for both GraphQL Federation and non-GraphQL
Federation subgraphs, non-GraphQL services, such as REST and gRPC, and also databases such as
MongoDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.

The GraphQL Mesh framework consists of two main components.

**Mesh Compose.** Combine muliple API sources (GraphQL, Federation, REST, gRPC, PostgreSQL, MySql
and co) into a single GraphQL supegraph.

**Mesh Serve.** The Gateway to serve your existing supergraph as provided by either Mesh Compose,
GraphQL Hive, Apollo GraphOS, or a proxy to your existing GraphQL API. Flexible support for
authentication, authorization, caching, rate-limiting and observability.
