# Introduction

GraphQL Mesh is a framework to **build GraphQL Gateways on top of GraphQL and non-GraphQL services**
including REST, gRPC, and more.

You can either compose your sources by using GraphQL Mesh Compose, and then serve it using GraphQL
Mesh Serve, or you can serve your existing unified graph (Federation Supergraph etc) by using
GraphQL Mesh Serve.
