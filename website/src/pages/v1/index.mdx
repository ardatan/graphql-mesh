# Introduction

Mesh is a GraphQL composition framework and gateway for both GraphQL Federation and non-GraphQL
Federation subgraphs, non-GraphQL services, such as REST and gRPC, and also databases such as
MongoDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.

    subgraph Backend Services
        C1["User Service (GraphQL)"]
        C2["Product Service (REST)"]
        C3["Order Database (PostgreSQL)"]
    end

The GraphQL Mesh framework consists of two main components.

**Mesh Compose.** Combine muliple API sources (GraphQL, Federation, REST, gRPC, PostgreSQL, MySql
and co) into a single GraphQL supegraph.

**Mesh Serve.** The Gateway to serve your existing supergraph as provided by either Mesh Compose,
GraphQL Hive, Apollo GraphOS, or a proxy to your existing GraphQL API. Flexible support for
authentication, authorization, caching, rate-limiting and observability.

### Next steps

Want to turn existing services into a GraphQL supergraph? Continue with Mesh Compose.

Already have a supergraph from a schema registry such as GraphQL Hive or Apollo GraphOS and want to
spin up a gateway? Continue with Mesh Serve.
