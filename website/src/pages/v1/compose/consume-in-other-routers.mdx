If you don't use Mesh Router, but still want to use Mesh Compose to convert non-federated sources to
a federated subgraph. You can still do it but it has some limitations, you need to generate the
subgraph, and serve the subgraph with [Mesh Serve](/v1/serve) But if you use Mesh Serve, you don't
need to worry about this, then you can use the supergraph directly without having multiple servers.

That's because other routers are not aware of Mesh Compose's additional directives to handle the
non-federated sources.

This means you can use non-federated sources in any Federation compliant gateway such as Apollo
Gateway, Apollo Router or Cosmo Router.

## Generate the subgraph

First, you need to generate the subgraph with Mesh Compose, and then serve the subgraph with Mesh
Serve.

```ts filename="mesh.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-mesh/compose-cli'
import { loadOpenAPISubgraph } from '@omnigraph/openapi'

export const composeConfig = defineConfig({
  subgraphs: [
    {
      sourceHandler: loadOpenAPISubgraph('Wiki', {
        source: 'https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/?spec'
      }),
      transforms: [
        /**.. **/
      ]
    }
  ]
})
```

Then you can run the following command to generate the subgraph:

```sh
npx mesh-compose --subgraph Wiki > wiki-subgraph.graphql
```

You can also use this schema with any schema registry such as [Hive](/v1/serve/schema-registry/hive)
or [GraphOS](/v1/serve/schema-registry/graphos).

<Callout>
For example, with GraphQL Hive CLI you can publish this subgraph with the following command:

```sh
hive schema:publish \
  --registry.accessToken YOUR_TOKEN_HERE \
  --service="reviews" \
  --url="http://fake.com/reviews/graphql" \
  --author "Me" \
  --commit "Second" \
  wiki-subgraph.graphql
```

</Callout>

## Serve the subgraph

Then you can serve the subgraph with Mesh Serve with the following command;

{/* TODO: Add the command to serve the subgraph` */}

```sh
npx mesh serve --subgraph wiki-subgraph.graphql
```

Then you can use the supergraph in any Federation compliant gateway such as Apollo Gateway, Apollo
Router or Cosmo Router.
