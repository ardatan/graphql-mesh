This handler allows you to use the GraphQL schema created by
[`@neo4j/graphql`](https://github.com/neo4j/graphql).

## How to use?

To get started, install the handler library:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @omnigraph/neo4j
```

Then you can import the library in your configuration file, and define your Neo4j source;

```ts filename="mesh.config.ts" {2,7-9}
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-mesh/compose-cli'
import { loadNeo4jSubgraph } from '@omnigraph/neo4j'

export const composeConfig = defineConfig({
  subgraphs: [
    {
      sourceHandler: loadNeo4jSubgraph('MyNeo4j', {
        url: 'neo4j://localhost',
        username: 'neo4j',
        password: 'MY_PASSWORD'
      })
    }
  ]
})
```
