# SOAP

<Callout>
  This page is currently under construction and expected to change. Please feel free to reach out to
  us directly in case you are having any troubles.

This handler allows you to consume [SOAP](https://soapui.org) `WSDL` files and generate a remote
executable schema for those services.

## How to use?

To get started, install the handler library:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @omnigraph/soap
```

Then you can import the library in your configuration file, and define your SOAP source;

```ts filename="mesh.config.ts" {2,7-9}
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-mesh/compose-cli'
import { loadSOAPSubgraph } from '@omnigraph/soap'

export const composeConfig = defineConfig({
  subgraphs: [
    {
      sourceHandler: loadSOAPSubgraph('CountryInfo', {
        source:
          'http://webservices.oorsprong.org/websamples.countryinfo/CountryInfoService.wso?WSDL'
      })
    }
  ]
})
```
