This handler allows you to use the GraphQL schema created by `graphql-compose-mongoose`.

To get started, install the handler library:

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @omnigraph/mongoose
```

Then, you can use it in your Mesh configuration:

```ts filename="mesh.config.ts"
import loadMongooseSubgraph from '@omnigraph/mongoose'
import { User } from './models.ts'

export const composeConfig = defineComposeConfig({
  subgraphs: [
    {
      sourceHandler: loadMongooseSubgraph('MyMongooseApi', {
        connectionString: 'mongodb://localhost:27017/test',
        models: {
          // You can provide your models here
          User
        }
      })
    }
  ]
})
```
