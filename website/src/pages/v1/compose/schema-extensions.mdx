# Schema Extensions

<Callout>
  This page is currently under construction and expected to change. Please feel free to reach out to
  us directly in case you are having any troubles.
</Callout>

Schema extensions add gateway-level type definitions and resolvers into a combined API, which is
useful for establishing connections between types that exist in separate subgraphs.

When considering these capabilities, be sure to compare them with the newer automated features
available through [type merging](/v1/compose/type-merging). While type merging frequently eliminates
the need for schema extensions, it does not preclude their use.

<Callout>

Schema delegation is a way to automatically forward a query (or a part of a query) from the unified
graph to an underlying subgraph that can execute the query.

Schema extensions are usually used to apply this approach to combine independent, uncontrolled
sources.

</Callout>

## Motivational Example

Let's say we have a `subgraph A`, and the supergraph like below;

```graphql filename="subgraph-a.graphql"
type Repository {
  id: ID!
  url: String
  issues: [Issue]
  userId: ID!
}

type Issue {
  id: ID!
  text: String!
  repository: Repository!
}

type Query {
  repositoryById(id: ID!): Repository
  repositoriesByUserId(id: ID!): [Repository]
}
```

And together with other composed subgraphs or extensions, we have the following supergraph;

```graphql filename="unifiedgraph.graphql" {18-27}
type Repository {
  id: ID!
  url: String
  issues: [Issue]
  userId: ID!
  user: User
}

type Issue {
  id: ID!
  text: String!
  repository: Repository!
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  username: String
  repositories: [Repository]
    @resolveTo(
      sourceName: "A"
      sourceTypeName: "Query"
      sourceFieldName: "repositoriesByUserId"
      requiredSelectionSet: "{ id }"
      sourceArgs: { id: "{root.id}" }
    )
}

type Query {
  userById(id: ID!): User
}
```

Suppose we want the supergraph to delegate retrieval of `repositories` to the `subgraph A`, in order
to execute queries such as this one:

```graphql
query {
  userById(id: "1") {
    id
    username
    repositories {
      id
      url
      user {
        username
        id
      }
      issues {
        text
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The resolver function for the `repositories` field of the `User` type would be responsible for the
delegation, in this case. While it’s possible to call a remote GraphQL endpoint or resolve the data
manually, this would require us to transform the query manually or always fetch all possible fields,
which could lead to overfetching. Delegation automatically extracts the appropriate query to send to
the `subgraph A`:

```graphql
# To Subgraph A
query ($id: ID!) {
  repositoriesByUserId(id: $id) {
    id
    url
    issues {
      text
    }
  }
}
```

The delegation also removes the fields that don’t exist on the subschema, such as `user`. This field
would be retrieved from the parent schema using normal GraphQL resolvers.

Each field on the `Repository` and `Issue` types use a special resolver to properly extract data
from the delegated response. The special resolver resolves aliases, converts custom scalars and
enums to their internal representations, and maps errors. So it is more than just a simple `fetch`
call, and return that.

## Basic Example

Let's say we have two subgraphs;

```graphql filename="posts.graphql"
type Post {
  id: ID!
  text: String
  userId: ID!
}

type Query {
  postById(id: ID!): Post
  postsByUserId(userId: ID!): [Post!]!
}
```

```graphql filename="users.graphql"
type User {
  id: ID!
  email: String
}

type Query {
  userById(id: ID!): User
}
```

We may want to navigate from a particular user to their posts, or from a post to its user. This is
possible within our service architecture by connecting an existing key of each object to a
corresponding root query:

- `Post.userId -> userById(id)` gets a Post’s user.
- `User.id -> postsByUserId(userId)` gets a User’s posts.

To formalize this navigation within our supergraph, we can extend each type with a new field that
will translate its respective key into an actual object association:

```ts filename="mesh.config.ts"
import { defineConfig as defineComposeConfig } from '@graphql-mesh/compose-cli'
import { loadGraphQLHTTPSubgraph } from '@graphql-mesh/graphql'

export const composeConfig = defineComposeConfig({
  subgraphs: [
    {
      sourceHandler: loadGraphQLHTTPSubgraph('Posts', {
        endpoint: 'http://localhost:4001/posts'
      })
    },
    {
      sourceHandler: loadGraphQLHTTPSubgraph('Users', {
        endpoint: 'http://localhost:4002/users'
      })
    }
  ],
  additionalTypeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
    extend type Post {
      user: User!
    }
    extend type User {
      posts: [Post!]!
    }
  `
})
```

The `additionalTypeDefs` option provides type extensions (using the extend keyword) that add
additional fields into the combined gateway schema and therefore may cross-reference types from any
subgraph.

However, these extensions alone won’t do anything until they have corresponding resolvers. A
complete example would look like this:

```ts filename="mesh.config.ts"
import { defineConfig as defineComposeConfig } from '@graphql-mesh/compose-cli'
import { loadGraphQLHTTPSubgraph } from '@graphql-mesh/graphql'

export const composeConfig = defineComposeConfig({
  subgraphs: [
    {
      sourceHandler: loadGraphQLHTTPSubgraph('Posts', {
        endpoint: 'http://localhost:4001/posts'
      })
    },
    {
      sourceHandler: loadGraphQLHTTPSubgraph('Users', {
        endpoint: 'http://localhost:4002/users'
      })
    }
  ],
  additionalTypeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
    extend type Post {
      user: User!
        @resolveTo(
          sourceName: "Users"
          sourceTypeName: "Query"
          sourceFieldName: "userById"
          requiredSelectionSet: "{ id }"
          sourceArgs: { id: "{root.userId}" }
        )
    }
    extend type User {
      posts: [Post!]!
        @resolveTo(
          sourceName: "Posts"
          sourceTypeName: "Query"
          sourceFieldName: "postsByUserId"
          requiredSelectionSet: "{ id }"
          sourceArgs: { userId: "{root.id}" }
        )
    }
  `
})
```

When resolving `User.posts` and `Post.user`, we delegate each key reference to its corresponding
root query.

- `sourceName` specifies the subgraph to delegate to.
- `sourceTypeName` and `sourceFieldName` specify the root query to call.
- `sourceArgs` specifies the arguments to be passed to the delegated field
- `requiredSelectionSet` above specifies the key field(s) needed from an object to query for its
  associations. For example, `Post.user` will require that a `Post` provide its `userId`. Rather
  than relying on incoming queries to manually request this key for the association, the selection
  set will automatically be included in `subgraph` requests to guarantee that these fields are
  fetched.

<Callout>
  By default, `resolveTo` assumes that the delegated operation will return the same GraphQL type as
  the resolved field (ex: a `User` field would delegate to a `User` query). If this is not the case,
  then you should manually provide a `returnType` option citing the expected GraphQL return type,
  and transform the result accordingly in the resolver.
</Callout>

- `returnType` specifies the expected return type of the delegated operation. This is necessary when
  the return type of the delegated operation differs from the type of the field being resolved. For
  example, if `Post.user` resolves to a `User` type, but the delegated operation returns a
  `UserResponse` type, then `returnType` should be set to `User`.
- `result` specifies the path to the data in the response that should be returned. This is necessary
  when the data is nested in the response. For example, if the response is
  `{ data: { user: { id: 1, name: "John" } } }`, then `result` should be set to `data.user`.

## Batch Delegation (Array Batching)

The drawback of performing individual `resolveTo` calls is that they can be fairly inefficient. Say
we request `Post.user` from an array of ten posts—that would delegate ten individual `userById`
queries while resolving each user! To improve this, we can instead delegate in batches, where many
instances of a field resolver are consolidated into one delegation.

To setup batching, the first thing we’ll need is a new query in the users’ service that allows
fetching many users at once:

```graphql
usersByIds(ids: [ID!]!): [User]!
```

With this many-users query available, we can now delegate the `Post.user` field in batches across
many records:

```ts filename="mesh.config.ts"
import { defineConfig as defineComposeConfig } from '@graphql-mesh/compose-cli'
import { loadGraphQLHTTPSubgraph } from '@graphql-mesh/graphql'

export const composeConfig = defineComposeConfig({
  subgraphs: [
    {
      sourceHandler: loadGraphQLHTTPSubgraph('Posts', {
        endpoint: 'http://localhost:4001/posts'
      })
    },
    {
      sourceHandler: loadGraphQLHTTPSubgraph('Users', {
        endpoint: 'http://localhost:4002/users'
      })
    }
  ],
  additionalTypeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
    extend type Post {
      user: User!
        @resolveTo(
          sourceName: "Users"
          sourceTypeName: "Query"
          sourceFieldName: "usersByIds"
          keyField: "userId"
          keysArg: "ids"
        )
    }
  `
})
```

<Callout>
Internally, `resolveTo` wraps a single `resolveTo` call in a `DataLoader` scoped by context, field, arguments, and query selection. It assumes that the delegated operation will return an array of objects matching the gateway field’s named GraphQL type (ex: a `User` field delegates to a `[User]` query). If this is not the case, then you should manually provide a `returnType` option citing the expected GraphQL return type. Since it is a thin wrapper around DataLoader, it also makes the following assumptions on the results:

The Array of values must be the same length as the Array of keys, and each index in the Array of
values must correspond to the same index in the Array of keys.

</Callout>

If the query you’re delegating to don’t conform to these expectations, you can provide a custom
resolver function in `additionalResolvers` in `serve-runtime` configuration.
{/* `TODO: Add example for custom resolver function programmatically` */}

Batch delegation is generally preferable over plain delegation because it eliminates the redundancy
of requesting the same field across an array of parent objects. Even so, delegation costs can add up
because there is still one subschema request made per batched field—for remote services, this may
create many network requests sent to the same service.

## Hiding internal fields

Let's say if you don't want to expose `usersByIds`, you can use
[Filter Transform](/v1/compose/transforms/filter) to hide it from the final schema. This is helpful
when you want to stitch subgraphs but you don't want to expose some extra fields that should not be
exposed to the client.

```ts filename="mesh.config.ts"
import {
  createFilterTransform,
  defineConfig as defineComposeConfig
} from '@graphql-mesh/compose-cli'
import { loadGraphQLHTTPSubgraph } from '@graphql-mesh/graphql'

export const composeConfig = defineComposeConfig({
  subgraphs: [
    {
      sourceHandler: loadGraphQLHTTPSubgraph('Posts', {
        endpoint: 'http://localhost:4001/posts'
      })
    },
    {
      sourceHandler: loadGraphQLHTTPSubgraph('Users', {
        endpoint: 'http://localhost:4002/users'
      }),
      transforms: [
        createFilterTransform({
          fieldFilter: (typeName, fieldName) => fieldName !== 'usersByIds'
        })
      ]
    }
  ],
  additionalTypeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
    extend type Post {
      user: User!
        @resolveTo(
          sourceName: "Users"
          sourceTypeName: "Query"
          sourceFieldName: "usersByIds"
          keyField: "userId"
          keysArg: "ids"
        )
    }
  `
})
```
