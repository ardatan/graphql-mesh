# Type Merging

Type merging allows _partial definitions_ of a type to exist in any subschema, all of which are
merged into one unified type in the gateway schema. When querying for a merged type, the gateway
smartly delegates portions of a request to each relevant subschema in dependency order and then
combines all results for the final return.

Type merging is now the preferred method of including GraphQL types across subschemas, replacing the
need for [schema extensions](/v1/compose/schema-extensions) (though does not preclude their use). To
migrate from schema extensions, simply enable type merging and then start replacing extensions one
by one with merges.

This concept today is the most preferred one to combine multiple subgraphs in GraphQL such as Apollo
Federation.

## Motivational Example

Let's talk about the use case we want without any configuration or setup to understand the concept.

Type merging allows each subschema to provide subsets of a type that it has data for.

Given the following subschemas;

```graphql filename="posts.graphql"
type Post {
  id: ID!
  message: String!
  author: User!
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  posts: [Post]!
}

type Query {
  postById(id: ID!): Post
  userById(id: ID!): User
}
```

```graphql filename="users.graphql"
type User {
  id: ID!
  email: String!
}

type Query {
  userById(id: ID!): User
}
```

Note that both services define a _different_ `User` type. While the users service manages
information about user accounts, the posts service simply provides posts associated with a user ID.
Now we just have to configure the `User` type to be merged. Type merging requires a query from each
subschema to provide its version of a merged type:

When we send the following query to the gateway;

```graphql
query {
  postById(id: "1") {
    id
    message
    author {
      id
      email
    }
  }
}
```

We want `Posts` subgraph to receive the following query;

```graphql
query {
  postById(id: "1") {
    id
    message
    author {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

And `Users` subgraph to receive the following query;

```graphql
query {
  userById(id: "1") {
    email
  }
}
```

And then the gateway should merge the results from both subgraphs and return the following result;

```json
{
  "data": {
    "postById": {
      "id": "1",
      "message": "Hello World",
      "author": {
        "id": "1",
        "email": "john@doe.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Automatic Type Merging

GraphQL Mesh Compose automatically enables Type Merging if you have the following patterns in your
subgraphs;

- The same type is defined in multiple subgraphs.
- Query fields with `TYPENAMEbyKEYNAME(KEYNAME: KEYTYPE): TYPENAME` pattern, and the `KEYNAME` is
  the same as the `KEYNAME` field of the type.

So actually the example above can do the expected work automatically by default without any
configuration. If your schema doesn't match this pattern, you can use
[transforms](/v1/compose/transforms) to manipulate the schema to match this pattern. Let's say you
don't have `userById` in `Posts` but `postUserById` instead. You can use the `rename` transform to
rename the field to match the pattern.

You can disable this behavior in your configuration by setting `ignoreSemanticConventions: true` in
your configuration;

```ts filename="mesh.config.ts"
import { defineConfig as defineComposeConfig } from '@graphql-mesh/compose-cli'

export default defineComposeConfig({
  ignoreSemanticConventions: true
  // ...
})
```

## Manual and Advanced Type Merging

If you have control over your schema, you can use Federation directives to configure Type Merging,
using Federation directives;
[Learn more here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/federated-types/federated-directives).

If you don't have control over your schema, you can use
[Federation Transform](/v1/compose/transforms/federation) to add the federation directives to your
schema, and specify an entity resolver using extra annotations on the transform level.
