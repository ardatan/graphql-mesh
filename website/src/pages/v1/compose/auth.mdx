# Authentication through directives

<Callout>
  This page is currently under construction and expected to change. Please feel free to reach out to
  us directly in case you are having any troubles.
</Callout>

You can use the `auth` and `skipAuth` directives to control access to your GraphQL API. These
directives are used to enforce authentication and authorization rules on your supergraph.

<Callout>
  You need to configure your gateway to use specific authentication rules in order to use these directives.

[See here to configure Generic Auth plugin for GraphQL Mesh Serve](/v1/serve/features/auth/generic-auth)

## Granular field access by Federation auth directives (`@authenticated`, `@requiresScopes`, `@policy`)

You can use the `authenticated` directive to enforce authentication rules on specific fields. This
directive can be used to restrict access to certain fields based on the viewer's session.

Then, you can use the `authenticated` directive to set authentication rules on fields:

Since `@authenticated` is a native directive, you can import it instead of defining it explicitly;

```graphql
extend schema @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.6", import: ["@authenticated"])

type Query {
  me: User! @authenticated
  protectedField: String @authenticated
  # publicField: String
}
```

<Callout>
  You can learn more about the auth directives in the gateway docs here. [Generic Auth in GraphQL
  Mesh Serve](/v1/serve/features/auth/generic-auth)
</Callout>

## Exclude fields from authentication by using schema field directive `@skipAuth`

If you have completely protected supergraph but allow unauthenticated access for certain fields by
annotating them.

You need to define the `skipAuth` directive in your schema:

```graphql
directive @skipAuth on FIELD_DEFINITION
```

Then, you can use the `skipAuth` directive to exclude fields from authentication:

```graphql
type Query {
  me: User!
  protectedField: String
  publicField: String @skipAuth
}
```

<Callout>
  In order to use this directive, you need to configure [Generic
  Auth](/v1/serve/features/auth/generic-auth) plugin to use **Complete Protection** in your GraphQL
  Mesh Gateway.
