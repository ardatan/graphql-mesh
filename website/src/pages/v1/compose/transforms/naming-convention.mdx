# Naming Convention Transform

The naming convention transforms allow you to apply casing and other conventions to your response.

## How to use?

You can import `createNamingConventionTransform` to create an instance of the transform. Each
parameter of the transform factory takes a function that takes a string, and returns another string.
So you can use your own convention functions, or use the provided ones like `pascalCase`,
`upperCase`, `camelCase`, etc.

```ts filename="mesh.config.ts" {13-17}
import {
  camelCase,
  createNamingConventionTransform,
  defineConfig as defineComposeConfig,
  loadGraphQLHTTPSubgraph,
  pascalCase,
  upperCase
} from '@graphql-mesh/compose-cli'

export const composeConfig = defineConfig({
  subgraphs: [
    {
      sourceHandler: loadGraphQLHTTPSubgraph('Countries', {
        endpoint: 'https://countries.trevorblades.com'
      }),
      transforms: [
        createNamingConventionTransform({
          typeNames: pascalCase,
          enumValues: upperCase,
          fieldNames: camelCase,
          fieldArgumentNames: camelCase
        })
      ]
    }
  ]
})
```
