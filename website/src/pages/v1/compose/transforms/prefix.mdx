# Prefix Transform

The prefix transform allows you to add prefixes to existing GraphQL types and root operations (under
`Query/Mutation`). Prefix transform is similar to [Rename Transform](/v1/compose/transforms/rename)
in that it allows you to modify names to avoid conflicts, simplify complicated names, and change the
appearance of your query. In contrast with the Rename Transform, Prefix Transform is simpler and
only allows you to append a **prefix** to the existing name.

You can use it to easily "namespace" APIs in your unified API and avoid conflicts.

## How to use?

You can import `createPrefixTransform` to create an instance of the transform. The `value` option is
the prefix that you want to add to the types and fields of the subgraph. In the example below, we
add `Countries_` to the types and fields of the subgraph.

```ts filename="mesh.config.ts" {13-17}
import {
  createPrefixTransform,
  defineConfig as defineComposeConfig,
  loadGraphQLHTTPSubgraph
} from '@graphql-mesh/compose-cli'

export const composeConfig = defineConfig({
  subgraphs: [
    {
      sourceHandler: loadGraphQLHTTPSubgraph('Countries', {
        endpoint: 'https://countries.trevorblades.com'
      }),
      transforms: [
        createPrefixTransform({
          value: 'Countries_'
        })
      ]
    }
  ]
})
```
