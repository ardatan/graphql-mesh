# Encapsulate Transform

The encapsulate transform allows to easily encapsulate a specific schema into a single field under
the root type.

For instance, if your handler created a schema like this, named `mySchema`:

```graphql
type Query {
  something: String
}

type Mutation {
  doSomething: String
}
```

The `encapsulate` transform will change your schema to this:

```graphql
type Query {
  mySchema: mySchemaQuery!
}

type Mutation {
  mySchema: mySchemaMutation!
}

type mySchemaQuery {
  something: String
}

type mySchemaMutation {
  doSomething: String
}
```

This transformer is useful when you have multiple APIs in your Mesh Gateway and you wish to have it
wrapped with a name to better understand where each field is coming from.

## How to use?

```ts filename="mesh.config.ts" {13-17}
import {
  createEncapsulateTransform,
  defineConfig as defineComposeConfig,
  loadGraphQLHTTPSubgraph
} from '@graphql-mesh/compose-cli'

export const composeConfig = defineConfig({
  subgraphs: [
    {
      sourceHandler: loadGraphQLHTTPSubgraph('mySchema', {
        endpoint: 'http://localhost:4001/my-schema'
      }),
      transforms: [
        createEncapsulateTransform({
          applyTo: {
            // This will apply the encapsulate transform only to query fields
            query: true,
            mutation: false,
            subscription: false
          }
        })
      ]
    }
  ]
})
```
