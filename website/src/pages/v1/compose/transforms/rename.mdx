The rename transform allows you to rename:

- GraphQL types
- GraphQL fields
- GraphQL field arguments

The `rename` transform helps you avoid conflicting names, simplify complicated names and make
queries look more like mutations.

## How to use?

You can import `createRenameTransform` to create an instance of the transform. You can use regular
JavaScript functions to rename types, fields, and field arguments.

```ts filename="mesh.config.ts" {13-17}
import {
  defineConfig as defineComposeConfig,
  loadGraphQLHTTPSubgraph,
  createRenameTransform
} from '@graphql-mesh/compose-cli'

export const composeConfig = defineConfig({
  subgraphs: [
    {
      sourceHandler: loadGraphQLHTTPSubgraph('Countries', {
        endpoint: 'https://countries.trevorblades.com'
      }),
      transforms: [
        createRenameTransform({
          // Rename types
          typeRenamer(typeName) {
            if (typeName === 'Country') {
              return 'MyCountry'
            }
          }
          // Rename fields
          fieldRenamer(fieldName, typeName) {
            if (typeName === 'Country' && fieldName === 'name') {
              return 'countryName'
            }
          }
          // Rename field arguments
          argRenamer(argName, fieldName, typeName) {
            if (typeName === 'Country' && fieldName === 'name' && argName === 'lang') {
              return 'language'
            }
          }
        })
      ]
    }
  ]
})
```
