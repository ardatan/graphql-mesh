GraphQL Mesh allows you to modify the schema easily, in order to control the contents of your
GraphQL requests and responses; you can use one of the built-in transforms or write your own.

Each transformer can manipulate the schema the way it needs and return the modified schema.

Transforms are specified as a list, and they are executed in order. You can apply them over a
specific input source or over the unified schema (after merging all sources).

You can see the available transforms under `Transforms` on the menu.
