# Rate Limiting through `@rateLimit` directive

Rate limiting is a technique for reducing server load by limiting the number of requests that can be
made to a subgraph.

This approach follows the pattern of
[`graphql-rate-limit`](https://github.com/teamplanes/graphql-rate-limit/blob/master/README.md#field-config).

To set rate limit hints in your subgraph schema, the `@rateLimit` directive definition should be
included in the subgraph schema

<Callout>
  The gateway's rate limiting feature should be enabled.
