# Response Caching through `@cacheControl` directive

Response caching is a technique for reducing server load by caching GraphQL query operation results.
For incoming GraphQL Query operations with the same variable values, the same response is returned
from a cache instead of executed again.

{/* `TODO: Test this feature with a real example` */}

To set static cache hints within subgraphs, the `@cacheControl` directive and `CacheControlScope`
enum definitions must be included in the subgraph schema:

```graphql
enum CacheControlScope {
  PUBLIC
  PRIVATE
}

directive @cacheControl(
  maxAge: Int
  scope: CacheControlScope
  inheritMaxAge: Boolean
) on FIELD_DEFINITION | OBJECT | INTERFACE | UNION
```

<Callout>
  The gateway's response caching feature should be enabled.

[See here to configure Response Cache plugin for GraphQL Mesh Serve](/v1/serve/features/performance/response-caching)

</Callout>

Then in the subgraph schema, you can use the @cacheControl directive to set cache hints on fields,
types, and interfaces:

## Time-to-live (TTL)

```ts filenmae="Response Cache configuration with TTL using @cacheControl directive"
import { cacheControlDirective } from '@graphql-yoga/plugin-response-cache'

const typeDefs = /* GraphQL */ `
  # the directive needs to be defined in the schema
  ${cacheControlDirective}

  type Query {
    # cache operations selecting Query.lazy for 10 seconds
    lazy: Something @cacheControl(maxAge: 10000)
  }

  # only cache query operations containing User for 500ms
  type User @cacheControl(maxAge: 500) {
    #...
  }
`
```

## Enforce session based caching

In some cases, a type or a field should only be cached if their is a session. For this, you can use
the `scope` to indicate that the cache should only be used if a session is present.

```graphql
type Query {
  me: User @cacheControl(scope: PRIVATE)
}

type User @cacheControl(scope: PRIVATE) {
  #...
}
```

Any query containing a type or a field with the scope `PRIVATE` will only be cached if a session is
present.
