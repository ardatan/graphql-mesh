# Mesh Serve

Mesh Serve is a GraphQL gateway for any JavaScript environment and runtime such as Node.js, Bun,
Deno, Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions, Cloudflare Workers, and more.

Mesh Serve supports two different modes:

- **Serve a Supergraph.** Serve a supergraph provided by [GraphQL Mesh Compose](/v1/compose) or any
  other Federation compliant composition tool such as
  [Apollo Rover](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/) or schema registry
  ([GraphQL Hive](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive),
  [Apollo GraphOS](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/))
- **Proxy a GraphQL API.** Mesh Serve can also act as a proxy to a GraphQL API for adding additional
  features such as [monitoring/tracing](/v1/serve/features/monitoring-tracing),
  [caching](/v1/serve/features/performance),
  [rate limiting](/v1/serve/features/security/rate-limiting),
  [security layers](/v1/serve/features/security) and more

## CLI Installation

You can install Serve CLI with your favorite package manager: ======= To summarize, GraphQL Mesh
Serve allows you to:

- Serve your supergraph in any environment that runs JavaScript
- Act as an HTTP proxy to enhance an existing GraphQL API
- Adds an extra layer of security, performance, and monitoring to your API

## Getting Started

### Option 1: Running with docker

Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine. If not, you can download and install it from the
official Docker website.

```sh
# make sure to change the path for your local mesh.config.ts
docker run -p 4000:4000 -v $(pwd)/local/path/mesh.config.ts:/app/mesh.config.ts:ro ghcr.io/ardatan/mesh-serve:v1
```

For more advanced Docker configurations, including using Docker Compose and creating custom Docker
images, refer to the detailed
[Docker guide under the deployment section](/v1/serve/deployment/docker).

### Option 2: Installation of CLI

To use the CLI, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed in your environment. Then,
you can install Serve CLI with your favorite package manager:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @graphql-mesh/serve-cli
```

## Serving a Supergraph

A Gateway for a composed supergraph file (`supergraph.graphql`) generated by
[Mesh Compose](/v1/compose) or any other compliant tool (GraphQL Hive, Apollo GraphOS) can be served
by running the following command.

```sh Serve a Supergraph from CLI
mesh-serve --supergraph=supergraph.graphql
```

**Note:** If you use GraphQL Hive or Apollo GraphOS, you can also configure Mesh Serve to poll the
supergraph from the corresponding schema registry.

## CLI Arguments

For a full list of CLI arguments, please refer to the [CLI Reference](./references/cli).

## Serve Configuration

Instead of providing the supergraph via a CLI parameter, you can also provide it via a configuration
file. The following list of files are loaded by default, sorted by priority:

- `mesh.config.ts` _(recommended)_
- `mesh.config.mts`
- `mesh.config.cts`
- `mesh.config.js`
- `mesh.config.mjs`
- `mesh.config.cjs`

The Mesh Serve configuration file is furthermore used for enabling additional features such as
authorization, authentication caching, rate limiting, and more.

You need to place the Mesh config file within the working directory from which you run the CLI.

```ts filename="mesh.config.ts"
import { defineConfig as defineServeConfig } from '@graphql-mesh/serve-cli'

export const serveConfig = defineServeConfig({
  // Configuration here
  supergraph: './supergraph.graphql'
})
```

For a full list of CLI arguments, please refer to the [Config Reference](./references/config).

## Proxy a GraphQL API

Mesh Serve can also act as a proxy to an existing GraphQL API. This is useful for adding additional
features such as monitoring/tracing, caching, rate limiting, security layers, and more.

You can configure Mesh Serve to proxy a GraphQL API by providing the URL of the API in the
configuration file.

```ts filename="mesh.config.ts"
import { defineConfig as defineServeConfig } from '@graphql-mesh/serve-cli'

export const serveConfig = defineServeConfig({
  proxy: {
    endpoint: 'https://example.com/graphql'
  }
})
```

If you now run `mesh-serve` from you terminal, Mesh Serve will start a gateway that proxies the
GraphQL API.
