Node.js is the most common runtime for JavaScript.

If you have Node.js environment, we highly recommend to use Mesh with Serve CLI as described in the
[introduction](/v1/serve). If you really want to use the runtime in a customized way. You can use
the `createGatewayRuntime` function from `@graphql-mesh/serve-runtime` package.

## Serve CLI

You can follow the introduction page directly to use Serve CLI. [See here](/v1/serve)

## Serve Runtime (advanced-only)

Use this method only if you know what you are doing. It is recommended to use Serve CLI for most
cases.

```ts
import { createServer } from 'http'
import { createGatewayRuntime } from '@graphql-mesh/serve-runtime'

const serveRuntime = createGatewayRuntime(/* Your configuration */)
const server = createServer(serveRuntime)
server.listen(4000, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:4000`)
})
```
