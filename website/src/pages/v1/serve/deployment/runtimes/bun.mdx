GraphQL Mesh provides you a cross-platform GraphQL Server. So you can easily integrate it into any
platform besides Node.js. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a modern JavaScript runtime like Node or Deno,
and it supports Fetch API as a first class citizen. So the configuration is really simple like any
other JS runtime with Mesh;

The following code is a simple example of how to use GraphQL Mesh with Bun.

```ts
import { createServeRuntime } from '@graphql-mesh/serve-runtime'

const serveRuntime = createServeRuntime(/* Your configuration */)

const server = Bun.serve({
  fetch: serveRuntime
})

console.info(
  `Server is running on ${new URL(
    server.graphqlEndpoint,
    `http://${server.hostname}:${server.port}`
  )}`
)
```
