# Server-side JavaScript Environments

For Node.js and other Node-compliant environments, you can use Serve CLI as described in the
[Node.js guide](/v1/serve/deployment/runtimes/nodejs). But if you want to use Mesh with a
server-side JavaScript environment that is not compatible with Node.js API, you can use the
`createServeRuntime` function from `@graphql-mesh/serve-runtime` package.

In this case, you have to pass your serve configuration inside `createServeRuntime` instead of
exporting it `serveConfig` from `mesh.config.ts` file.

See the guides on the left for examples with different server-side JavaScript environments.
