[Express is the most popular web framework for Node.js.](https://expressjs.com/) It is a minimalist
framework that provides a robust set of features to handle HTTP on Node.js applications. You can
easily integrate GraphQL Mesh into your Express application with a few lines of code.

## Example

```ts
import express from 'express'
import { createGatewayRuntime } from '@graphql-mesh/serve-runtime'

const app = express()

const serveRuntime = createGatewayRuntime(/* Your configuration */)

// Bind GraphQL Mesh to the graphql endpoint to avoid rendering the playground on any path
app.use(serveRuntime.graphqlEndpoint, serveRuntime)

app.listen(4000, () => {
  console.log('Running a GraphQL API server at http://localhost:4000/graphql')
})
```

## Using Helmet

If you are using [Helmet](https://helmetjs.github.io/) to set your
[Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP), you can use the
following configuration:

```ts
app.use(
  helmet({
    contentSecurityPolicy: {
      directives: {
        'style-src': ["'self'", 'unpkg.com'],
        'script-src': ["'self'", 'unpkg.com', "'unsafe-inline'"],
        'img-src': ["'self'", 'raw.githubusercontent.com']
      }
    }
  })
)
```

[See GraphiQL documentation page for more informations](../features/graphiql#usage-with-content-security-policy)

### Isolate GraphiQL configuration

To avoid applying this configuration to other endpoints you may have on your Express server, you can
use `Express.Router` to create a new router instance and apply the configuration only to the GraphQL
Mesh endpoint.

```ts
import express from 'express'
import helmet from 'helmet'
import { createGatewayRuntime } from '@graphql-mesh/serve-runtime'

const app = express()

const serveRuntime = createGatewayRuntime(/* Your configuration */)
const meshRouter = express.Router()
// GraphiQL specefic CSP configuration
meshRouter.use(
  helmet({
    contentSecurityPolicy: {
      directives: {
        'style-src': ["'self'", 'unpkg.com'],
        'script-src': ["'self'", 'unpkg.com', "'unsafe-inline'"],
        'img-src': ["'self'", 'raw.githubusercontent.com']
      }
    }
  })
)
meshRouter.use(serveRuntime)

// By adding the GraphQL Mesh router before the global helmet middleware,
// you can be sure that the global CSP configuration will not be applied to the GraphQL Mesh endpoint
app.use(serveRuntime.graphqlEndpoint, meshRouter)

// Add the global CSP configuration for the rest of your server.
app.use(helmet())

// You can know register your other endpoints that will not be affected by the GraphiQL CSP configuration
app.get('/hello', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!')
})

app.listen(4000, () => {
  console.log('Running a GraphQL API server at http://localhost:4000/graphql')
})
```
