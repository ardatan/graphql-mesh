# Integration with SvelteKit

[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) is a framework for rapidly developing robust, performant web
applications using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). You can easily integrate Mesh Serve into your
SvelteKit powered application.

## Example

SvelteKit is typically used together with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) with the project structure
[looking like this](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/project-structure). We also assume that you have
composed a `supergraph.graphql` with [Mesh Compose](/v1/compose).

In this example, we want to integrate Mesh Serve into Vite's routes, we'll therefore use the
runtime.

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @graphql-mesh/serve-runtime
```

Keeping the [aforementioned project layout](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/project-structure) in mind,
create a new server route in `my-project/src/routes/graphql/+server.ts` to expose the GraphQL server
at `/graphql` and implement using the Mesh Serve runtime like this:

```ts filename="my-project/src/routes/graphql/+server.ts"
import { createServeRuntime } from '@graphql-mesh/serve-runtime'

const serve = createServeRuntime({
  supergraph: 'supergraph.graphql', // working directory is root of the project
  graphqlEndpoint: '/graphql', // matches the server route path
  fetchAPI: { Response } // use the native `Response`
})

export { serve as GET, serve as POST }
```
