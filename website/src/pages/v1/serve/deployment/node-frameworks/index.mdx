# Node.js Frameworks

We highly recommend to use Mesh with Serve CLI in Node.js as described in
[Node.js guide](/v1/serve/deployment/runtimes/nodejs). But if you want to use Mesh with a Node.js
framework, you can use the `createServeRuntime` function from `@graphql-mesh/serve-runtime` package.

In this case, you have to pass your serve configuration inside `createServeRuntime` instead of
exporting it `serveConfig` from `mesh.config.ts` file.

It handles Node.js request and response types which are
[IncomingMessage](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage) and
[ServerResponse](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse).

If your framework has middlewares and so on, you can handle the response by yourself as in
[Fastify example](/v1/serve/deployment/node-frameworks/fastify).

Choose your framework from the list on the left to see an example.
