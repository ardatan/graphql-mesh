[Koa is a new web framework designed by the team behind Express, which aims to be a smaller, more expressive, and more robust foundation for web applications and APIs.](https://koajs.com)

GraphQL Mesh can be integrated easily as a route to the existing Koa application with a few lines of
code.

[So you can benefit middlewares written for Koa with GraphQL Mesh.](https://github.com/koajs/koa/wiki)

## Example

```ts
import Koa from 'koa'
import { createServeRuntime } from '@graphql-mesh/serve-runtime'

const app = new Koa()

const serveRuntime = createServeRuntime<Koa.ParameterizedContext>()

// Bind GraphQL Mesh to `/graphql` endpoint
app.use(async ctx => {
  // Second parameter adds Koa's context into GraphQL Context
  const response = await serveRuntime.handleNodeRequestAndResponse(ctx.req, ctx.res, ctx)

  // Set status code
  ctx.status = response.status

  // Set headers
  response.headers.forEach((value, key) => {
    ctx.append(key, value)
  })

  if (response.body) {
    // Set body
    ctx.body = response.body
  }
})

app.listen(4000, () => {
  console.log(
    `Running a GraphQL API server at http://localhost:4000/${serveRuntime.graphqlEndpoint}`
  )
})
```
