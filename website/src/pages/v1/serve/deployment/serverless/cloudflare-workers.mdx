# Deploying Hive Gateway to Cloudflare Workers

Hive Gateway a provides you a cross-platform GraphQL Server. So you can easily integrate it into any
platform besides Node.js.

[Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers) provides a serverless execution
environment that allows you to create entirely new applications or augment existing ones without
configuring or maintaining infrastructure.

<Callout>
  Before you start, make sure you read the [Serverless / On the
  Edge](/v1/serve/deployment/serverless) page.
</Callout>

```ts
import { createGatewayRuntime } from '@graphql-hive/gateway'

const gatewayRuntime = createGatewayRuntime({
  // gatewayConfig
})

export default { fetch: gatewayRuntime }
```

<Callout>
  If you want to use [Cloudflare KV
  Cache](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/kv) as a distributed cache, [see
  here for Hive Gateway integration](/v1/serve/features/performance#cloudflare-workers-kv)
