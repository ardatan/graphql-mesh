Azure Functions is a serverless environment that supports JavaScript. Mesh is platform agnostic and
can be deployed to Azure Functions as well.

<Callout>
  Before you start, make sure you read the [Serverless / On the
  Edge](/v1/serve/deployment/serverless) page.
</Callout>

```ts
import { app } from '@azure/functions'
import { createGatewayRuntime } from '@graphql-mesh/serve-runtime'

const handler = createGatewayRuntime(/* Your configuration */)

app.http('graphql', {
  method: ['GET', 'POST'],
  handler
})
```
