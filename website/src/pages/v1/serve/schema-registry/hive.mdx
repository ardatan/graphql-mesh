# Integration with GraphQL Hive

import { Callout } from '@theguild/components'

[GraphQL Hive](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive) is a schema registry, monitoring and analytics
tool for your GraphQL API, and it is possible to integrate your GraphQL Mesh application to GraphQL
Hive.

GraphQL Mesh Serve can fetch the supergraph from Hive's High-Availablity CDN, and serve it with a
few lines of configuration.

By using the built-in Hive plugin, it allows you to monitor and analyze the operation performance.

[Learn more about GraphQL Hive](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs)

## Fetching Supergraph from Hive CDN

GraphQL Mesh can fetch the supergraph directly from GraphQL Hive CDN by a few lines of configuration
without any additional setup for Federation projects.

[Learn more about how to setup an Federation project on Hive](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/get-started/apollo-federation)

Once you get the credentials for Hive CDN, you can setup your GraphQL Mesh configuration to fetch
the supergraph from Hive CDN.

### Configuration

```ts filename="mesh.config.ts"
import { defineConfig as defineServeConfig } from '@graphql-mesh/serve-cli'

export default defineServeConfig({
  hive: {
    // The endpoint of CDN
    endpoint: 'CDN_ENDPOINT',
    // The API key provided by GraphQL Hive
    key: 'API_KEY'
  }
})
```

<Callout>
  Instead of providing `endpoint` and `key`, you can provide these two using environment variables
  `HIVE_CDN_ENDPOINT` and `HIVE_CDN_KEY` without any configuration file needed.

```sh
HIVE_CDN_ENDPOINT=CDN_ENDPOINT HIVE_CDN_KEY=API_KEY npx mesh-serve
```

</Callout>

## Publishing subgraphs to Hive CDN

If you generate a subgraph using [Mesh Compose](/v1/serve/compose), you can publish the subgraph to
Hive CDN. Before publishing the subgraph, you need to output your subgraph as a GraphQL SDL file
like `schema.graphql`. Basically you can export a subgraph by using the following command of Mesh
Compose;

```sh
npx mesh-compose --subgraph SUBGRAPH_NAME > SUBGRAPH_NAME.graphql
```

Then you can publish the subgraph to Hive CDN by using the following command;

```sh
npx hive schema:publish \
  --registry.accessToken YOUR_TOKEN_HERE \
  --service="SUBGRAPH_NAME" \
  --url="http://my-subgraph.com" \
  --author "Me" \
  --commit "First" \
  SUBGRAPH_NAME.graphql
```

## Usage Reporting and Monitoring

Hive allow you to collect usage data from your GraphQL operations and use the data collected for
**Monitoring, Observability, Schema Usage and Coverage and Schema Evolution**.

[Learn more about Usage Reporting and Monitoring in Hive](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/features/usage-reporting)

In order to get started, you need to make sure you have a registry token from Hive.

[Learn more about how to get a registry token](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/get-started/apollo-federation#hive-cli-access-token)

Then you can setup your GraphQL Mesh configuration to send the usage data to Hive.

### Configuration

```ts filename="mesh.config.ts"
import { defineConfig as defineServeConfig } from '@graphql-mesh/serve-cli'

export default defineServeConfig({
  hive: {
    // The registry token provided by GraphQL Hive
    token: 'MY-REGISTRY-TOKEN'
  }
})
```

<Callout>
  Instead of providing `token`, you can provide it using environment variable `HIVE_REGISTRY_TOKEN`
  without any configuration file needed.

```sh
HIVE_REGISTRY_TOKEN=MY-REGISTRY-TOKEN npx mesh-serve
```

</Callout>
