# GraphQL Hive Integration

import { Callout } from '@theguild/components'

[GraphQL Hive](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive) is a schema registry, monitoring and analytics
tool for your GraphQL API.

GraphQL Mesh Serve can be configured to fetch the supergraph from Hive's High-Availablity CDN and
report usage data to Hive's registry.

## Serve Supergraph from GraphQL Hive

For [Federation projects](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/get-started/apollo-federation) on
GraphQL Hive, you can fetch the supergraph directly from GraphQL Hive CDN.

GraphQL Mesh can fetch the supergraph directly from GraphQL Hive CDN by a few lines of configuration
without any additional setup for Federation projects.

Before getting started, make sure you have
[obtained the credentials for the Hive CDN](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/features/high-availability-cdn#cdn-access-tokens).

### Configuration

For running Mesh Serve with the Hive CDN, you need to provide the necessary options to the CLI:

```sh filename="Run the Mesh Serve CLI"
npx mesh-serve supergraph <endpoint> --hive-cdn-key <api_key>
```

Instead of providing the CLI options, you can also provide them using a configuration file.

```ts filename="mesh.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-mesh/serve-cli'

export const serveConfig = defineConfig({
  supergraph: {
    // The CDN type.
    type: 'hive',
    // The endpoint of CDN
    endpoint: '<endpoint>',
    // The API key provided by GraphQL Hive
    key: '<api_key>'
  }
})
```

## Usage Reporting and Monitoring

Hive allow you to collect usage data from your GraphQL operations and use the data collected for
[**Monitoring, Observability, Schema Usage and Coverage and Schema Evolution**](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/features/usage-reporting).

Before getting started, make sure you have
[obtained a registry token from Hive](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/get-started/apollo-federation#hive-cli-access-token).

### Configuration

If you want Mesh Serve to report usage metrics to Hive, you need to provide the necessary options to
the CLI:

```sh filename="Run the Mesh Serve CLI"
npx mesh-serve supergraph --hive-registry-token <token>
```

Instead of using CLI options, you can also use a configuration file, which allows further
customization for the configuration:

```ts filename="mesh.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-mesh/serve-cli'

export const serveConfig = defineConfig({
  reporting: {
    // The reporting service type
    type: 'hive',
    // The registry token provided by GraphQL Hive
    token: '<token>'
  }
})
```

Refer to to the
[Hive Client documentation](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/api-reference/client#configuration)
for further customization, such as usage reporting sampling and more.

## Persisted Documents

Persisted documents can be used on your GraphQL server or Gateway to reduce the payload size of your
GraphQL requests and secure your GraphQL API by only allowing operations that are known and trusted
by your Gateway. GraphQL Hive can serve as a CDN for the persisted documents as they're requested.

Make sure you have configured **Persisted Documents** on GraphQL Hive as described
[here](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/features/app-deployments#persisted-documents-on-graphql-server-and-gateway).

### Configuration

After getting `endpoint` and `token` from GraphQL Hive, you can enable persisted documents in Mesh
Serve.

```sh filename="Run the Mesh Serve CLI"
npx mesh-serve supergraph "<cdn_endpoint>" --hive-persisted-documents-token "<cdn_access_token>" < endpoint > --hive-persisted-documents-endpoint
```

Or you can use a configuration file:

```ts filename="mesh.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-mesh/serve-cli'

export const serveConfig = defineConfig({
  persistedDocuments: {
    type: 'hive',
    endpoint: '<cdn_endpoint>',
    token: '<cdn-access-token>'
  }
})
```

#### Enabling Arbitrary Documents (not recommended)

By default, Mesh Server only allows persisted documents that are known and trusted by your Gateway.
If you want to allow arbitrary documents, you can enable the `allowArbitraryDocuments` option:

```ts filename="mesh.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-mesh/serve-cli'

export const serveConfig = defineConfig({
  persistedDocuments: {
    type: 'hive',
    endpoint: '<cdn_endpoint>',
    token: '<cdn-access-token>',
    allowArbitraryDocuments: true
  }
})
```
