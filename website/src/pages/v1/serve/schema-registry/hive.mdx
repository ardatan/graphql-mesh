# Integration with GraphQL Hive

`TODO: Finish this PR https://github.com/ardatan/graphql-mesh/pull/7096/files`

[GraphQL Hive](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive) is a schema registry, monitoring and analytics
tool for your GraphQL API, and it is possible to integrate your GraphQL Mesh application to GraphQL
Hive by using the dedicated plugins and transforms.

GraphQL Mesh Serve can fetch the supergraph from Hive's High-Availablity CDN, and serve it with a
few lines of configuration.

By using the built-in Hive plugin, it allows you to monitor and analyze the operation performance.

## How to use?

GraphQL Mesh has a built-in support for GraphQL Hive. In this case, you don't need to provide
`supergraph` in your configuration, but the credentials provided by GraphQL Hive;

```ts filename="mesh.config.ts"
import { defineConfig as defineServeConfig } from '@graphql-mesh/serve-cli'

export default defineServeConfig({
  hive: {
    // The endpoint of CDN
    endpoint: 'CDN_ENDPOINT',
    // The API key provided by GraphQL Hive
    token: 'API_KEY'
    // TODO: Add other plugin options here
  }
})`TODO: Persisted Operations`
```
