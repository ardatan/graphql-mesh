# GraphQL Hive Integration

import { Callout } from '@theguild/components'

[GraphQL Hive](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive) is a schema registry, monitoring and analytics
tool for your GraphQL API.

GraphQL Mesh Serve can be configured to fetch the supergraph from Hive's High-Availablity CDN and
report usage data to Hive's registry.

## Serve Supergraph from GraphQL Hive

For [Federation projects](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/get-started/apollo-federation) on
GraphQL Hive, you can fetch the supergraph directly from GraphQL Hive CDN.

GraphQL Mesh can fetch the supergraph directly from GraphQL Hive CDN by a few lines of configuration
without any additional setup for Federation projects.

Before getting started, make sure you have
[obtained the credentials for the Hive CDN](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/features/high-availability-cdn#cdn-access-tokens).

### Configuration

For running Mesh Serve with the Hive CDN, you need to provide the `HIVE_CDN_ENDPOINT` and
`HIVE_CDN_KEY` environment variables.

```sh filename="Run the Mesh Serve CLI"
HIVE_CDN_ENDPOINT="CDN_ENDPOINT" HIVE_CDN_KEY="API_KEY" npx mesh-serve
```

Instead of providing the environment variables `HIVE_CDN_ENDPOINT` and `HIVE_CDN_KEY`, you can also
provide them using a configuration file.

```ts filename="mesh.config.ts"
import { defineConfig as defineServeConfig } from '@graphql-mesh/serve-cli'

export default defineServeConfig({
  hive: {
    // The endpoint of CDN
    endpoint: 'CDN_ENDPOINT',
    // The API key provided by GraphQL Hive
    key: 'API_KEY'
  }
})
```

## Usage Reporting and Monitoring

Hive allow you to collect usage data from your GraphQL operations and use the data collected for
[**Monitoring, Observability, Schema Usage and Coverage and Schema Evolution**](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/features/usage-reporting).

Before getting started, make sure you have
[obtained a registry token from Hive](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/get-started/apollo-federation#hive-cli-access-token).

### Configuration

Instead of providing `token`, you can provide it using environment variable `HIVE_REGISTRY_TOKEN`
without any configuration file needed.

```sh filename="Run the Mesh Serve CLI"
HIVE_REGISTRY_TOKEN="MY_REGISTRY_TOKEN" npx mesh-serve
```

Instead of using environment variables, you can also use a configuration file, which allows further
customization for the configuration.

```ts filename="mesh.config.ts"
import { defineConfig as defineServeConfig } from '@graphql-mesh/serve-cli'

export default defineServeConfig({
  hive: {
    // The registry token provided by GraphQL Hive
    token: 'MY-REGISTRY-TOKEN'
  }
})
```

Refer to to the
[Hive Client documentation](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/api-reference/client#configuration)
for further customization, such as usage reporting sampling and more.
