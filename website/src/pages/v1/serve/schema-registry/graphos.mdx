# Integration with Apollo GraphOS

import { Callout } from '@theguild/components'

Apollo GraphOS is a schema registry that allows you to store and manage your supergraph schemas. You
can use GraphQL Mesh to serve your supergraph schemas stored in Apollo GraphOS, or send usage data
to Apollo GraphOS.

## How to use?

By default, Mesh will use standard Apollo GraphOS environment variables.

```sh
APOLLO_KEY='<YOU_APOLLO_API_KEY>' APOLLO_GRAPH_REF='<YOUR_GRAPH_ID>[@<VARIANT>]' mesh-serve supergraph
```

<Callout>
  If you don’t know where to find these values, please refer to the [Apollo GraphOS
  documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/managed-federation/setup/#4-connect-your-router-to-graphos).
</Callout>

You can also provide this configuration programaitically by providing a configuration object, along
with other options to customize the polling/retry behavior.

```ts filename="mesh.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-mesh/serve-cli'

export const serveConfig = defineConfig({
  graphos: {
    /**
     * The graph ref of the managed federation graph.
     * It is composed of the graph ID and the variant (`<YOUR_GRAPH_ID>@<VARIANT>`).
     *
     * If not provided, `APOLLO_GRAPH_REF` environment variable is used.
     *
     * You can find a a graph's ref at the top of its Schema Reference page in Apollo Studio.
     */
    graphRef: '<YOUR_GRAPH_ID>[@<VARIANT>]',
    /**
     * The API key to use to authenticate with the managed federation up link.
     * It needs at least the `service:read` permission.
     *
     * If not provided, `APOLLO_KEY` environment variable will be used instead.
     *
     * [Learn how to create an API key](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/v1/managed-federation/setup#4-connect-the-gateway-to-studio)
     */
    apiKey: '<YOUR_APOLLO_API_KEY>'
  }
})
```

Other more advanced options are available, please refer to the type definitions for more
information.
