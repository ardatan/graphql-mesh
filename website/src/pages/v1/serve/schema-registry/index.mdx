# Schema Registry

import { Callout } from '@theguild/components'

GraphQL Schema Registry is a service that allows you to store and manage your GraphQL schemas. You
can use GraphQL Mesh to serve your supergraph schemas stored in a schema registry, or send usage
data to a schema registry.

A schema registry is usually recommended for;

- Observability for operation performance
- Schema usage and coverage to understand which fields are used and how often.
- Breaking changes, validation and schema evolution to understand the impact of changes on the
  client

## Built-in Integration

GraphQL Mesh supports the following schema registry integrations without any additional
configuration:

- [GraphQL Hive](/v1/serve/schema-registry/hive)
- [Apollo GraphOS](/v1/serve/schema-registry/graphos)

## Custom Integration

You can also use a custom schema registry by providing a configuration object, along with other
options to customize the polling/retry behavior.

```ts filename="mesh.config.ts"
import { defineConfig as defineServeConfig } from '@graphql-mesh/serve-cli'

export default defineServeConfig({
  supergraph: () =>
    // Fetch the supergraph from the schema registry
    fetch('https://my-registry.com/supergraph.graphql', {
      headers: {
        Authorization: 'Bearer MY_TOKEN'
      }
    }).then(res => res.text()),
  // Poll the schema registry every 10 seconds
  polling: 10000,
  plugins: ctx => [
    // You can also write your custom plugins to interact with the schema registry
    useMyCustomPlugin(ctx)
  ]
})
```

  Refer to the [custom plugins docs](/v1/serve/features/custom-plugins) for more information on how
  to write custom plugins.
