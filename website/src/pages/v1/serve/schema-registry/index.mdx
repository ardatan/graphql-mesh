# Schema Registry

import { Callout, Cards } from '@theguild/components'

A GraphQL schema registry is a centralized service that stores, manages, and versions GraphQL
schemas, ensuring consistency and compatibility across different services and teams.

The benefits of using a schema registry include:

- Observability for operation performance
- Schema usage and coverage to understand which fields are used and how often.
- Breaking changes, validation and schema evolution to understand the impact of changes on the
  client

Mesh Serve can serve the supergraph from a schema registry and report usage data to the registry.

## Built-in Integrations

GraphQL Mesh has built in support for the following schema registries.

<Cards>
  <Cards.Card arrow title="GraphQL Hive" href="/v1/serve/schema-registry/hive" />
  <Cards.Card arrow title="Apollo GraphOS" href="/v1/serve/schema-registry/graphos" />
</Cards>

## Custom Integration

You can also use a custom schema registry by providing a configuration object, along with other
options to customize the polling/retry behavior.

```ts filename="mesh.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-mesh/serve-cli'

export const serveConfig = defineConfig({
  supergraph: () =>
    // Fetch the supergraph from the schema registry
    fetch('https://my-registry.com/supergraph.graphql', {
      headers: {
        Authorization: 'Bearer MY_TOKEN'
      }
    }).then(res => res.text()),
  // Poll the schema registry every 10 seconds
  polling: 10000,
  plugins: ctx => [
    // You can also write your custom plugins to interact with the schema registry
    useMyCustomPlugin(ctx)
  ]
})
```

Refer to the [custom plugins docs](/v1/serve/features/custom-plugins) for more information.
