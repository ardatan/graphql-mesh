# Prometheus

[Prometheus](https://www.prometheus.io/) is a platform for scraping metrics from services and
utilities. You can use `@graphql-mesh/plugin-prometheus` plugin to expose and collect metrics from
all phases of your GraphQL execution including internal query planning and outgoing HTTP requests.

This plugin tracks the complete gateway execution flow.

The metrics gathered are then exposed in a format that Prometheus can scrape on a regular basis on
an HTTP endpoint (`/metrics` by default).

## Getting Started

First, please install the Mesh prometheus plugin and the community prometheus client for Node.js.

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @graphql-mesh/plugin-prometheus prom-client
```

You can then add the plugin and its configuration to your `mesh.config.ts` file.

```ts filename="mesh.config.ts"
import usePrometheus from '@graphql-mesh/plugin-prometheus'
import { defineConfig as defineServeConfig } from '@graphql-mesh/serve-cli'

export const serveConfig = defineServeConfig({
  // ...other options

  plugins: pluginCtx => [
    usePrometheus({
      ...pluginCtx,

      // Enable the metrics you want to expose
      // In this example, we enable incoming and outgoing HTTP request durations metrics
      http: true
      fetchMetrics: true
    })
  ]
})
```

You can now start your Mesh gateway and make some requests to it. The plugin will start collecting
metrics, and you can access them by visiting the `/metrics` endpoint.

## Exposed metrics

By default, the plugin will not expose any metrics. You need to opt-in to the metrics you wish to
export.

To enable a metric, set the corresponding option to `true`. You can also provide a string to
customize the metric name, or an object to provide more options (see
[`siimon/prom-client` documentation](https://github.com/siimon/prom-client#custom-metrics)).

Each metrics also exposes some labels to give more context. Please see details section of each
metric to see the available labels. Some labels can be enabled or disabled using the `labels`
option.

### `graphql_yoga_http_duration`

This metric tracks the duration of incoming (downstream) HTTP requests. It reports the time spent to
process each incoming request as an histogram.

This is useful to track the responsiveness of your gateway. A spike in this metric could indicate a
performance issue and that further investigation is needed.

To enable this metric, set the `http` option to `true`.

#### Labels

This metrics includes some useful labels to help you identify requests and group them together.

##### `method`

The HTTP method used to request the gateway endpoint. Since GraphQL usualy only uses `POST`
requests, this can be used to filetr out GraphiQL related requests.

This can be any HTTP verbs, including unallowed ones. Which means this metrics can also be used to
track malformed or malicious requests.

##### `statusCode`

The HTTP status code returned by the gateway. You probably want to filter out non-`200` responses to
have a view of the successful requests.

This can help you identify which requests are failing and why. Since GraphQL errors are returned as
`200 OK` responses, this can be useful to track errors that are not related to the GraphQL, like
malformed requests.

##### `operationName`

If available, the name of the GraphQL operation requested, otherwise `Anonymous`.

This can help you identify which operations are slow or failing. We recommend you to always provide
an operation name to your queries and mutations to help performance analysis and bug tracking.

This label is enabled by default, but can be disable by setting `labels.operationName` to false.

#### Sample output

```
# HELP graphql_yoga_http_duration Time spent on HTTP connection
# TYPE graphql_yoga_http_duration histogram
graphql_yoga_http_duration_bucket{le="0.005",method="GET",statusCode="200",operationName="Anonymous"} 1

graphql_yoga_http_duration_sum{method="GET",statusCode="200",operationName="Anonymous"} 3
graphql_yoga_http_duration_count{method="GET",statusCode="200",operationName="Anonymous"} 4
```

### `graphql_mesh_fetch_duration`

This metric tracks the duration of outgoing (upstream) HTTP requests. It reports the time spent on
each request made during the execution of the GraphQL operation as an histogram.

This metric can provide insights into which upstream service is slowing down your queries.

To enable this metric, set the `fetchMetrics` option to `true`.

#### Labels

This metrics includes some useful labels to help you identify requests and group them together.

##### `url`

The URL of the upstream request.

##### `method`

The HTTP method of the upstream request.

##### `statusCode`

The status code of the upstream response.

##### `statusText`

The status text of the upstream response.

##### `requestHeaders`

A JSON encoded object containing the headers of the upstream request. This is disabled by default,
set `labels.fetchRequestHeaders` option to `true` to enable it.

##### `responseHeaders`

A JSON encoded object containing the headers of the upstream response. This is disabled by default,
set `labels.fetchResponseHeaders` option to `true` to enable it.

#### Sample output

```
# HELP graphql_mesh_fetch_duration Time spent on outgoing HTTP calls
# TYPE graphql_mesh_fetch_duration histogram

graphql_mesh_fetch_duration_count{url="https://upstream/graphql",method="POST",statusCode="200",statusText="OK"} 2
```

### `graphql_mesh_subgraph_execute_duration`

This metric tracks the duration of subgraph execution. It reports the time spent on each subgraph
queries made to resolve incoming operations as an histogram.

This metric can provide insights into which subgraph is slowing down your queries.

To enable this metric, set the `subgraphExecute` option to `true`.

#### Labels

##### `subgraphName`

The name of the targeted subgraph.

##### `operationType`

The type of the graphql operation requested. This can be one of `query`, `mutation`, or
`subscription`.

#### Sample output

```
# HELP graphql_mesh_subgraph_execute_duration Time spent on subgraph execution
# TYPE graphql_mesh_subgraph_execute_duration histogram
graphql_mesh_subgraph_execute_duration_bucket{le="0.005",subgraphName="upstream",operationType="query"} 0

graphql_mesh_subgraph_execute_duration_sum{subgraphName="upstream",operationType="query"} 889
graphql_mesh_subgraph_execute_duration_count{subgraphName="upstream",operationType="query"} 2
```

## Custom Registry

You can customize the client’s registry by passing a custom registry to the `registry` option.

```ts filename="mesh.config.ts"
import { Registry } from 'prom-client'
import usePrometheus from '@graphql-mesh/plugin-prometheus'
import { defineConfig as defineServeConfig } from '@graphql-mesh/serve-cli'

const myRegistry = new Registry()

export const serveConfig = defineServeConfig({
  plugins: pluginCtx => [
    usePrometheus({
      ...pluginCtx,
      registry: myRegistry
    })
  ]
})
```

## Examples

### All metrics enabled

```ts filename="mesh.config.ts"
import usePrometheus from '@graphql-mesh/plugin-prometheus'
import { defineConfig as defineServeConfig } from '@graphql-mesh/serve-cli'

export const serveConfig = defineServeConfig({
  plugins: pluginCtx => [
    usePrometheus({
      ...pluginCtx,

      // Enable all available metrics
      requestCount: true,
      requestSummary: true,
      parse: true,
      validate: true,
      contextBuilding: true,
      execute: true,
      subscribe: true,
      errors: true,
      delegation: true,
      fetchMetrics: true,
      http: true
      deprecatedFields: true,
      requestTotalDuration: true,
      schemaChangeCount: true,
      subgraphExecute: true,
      subgraphExecuteErrors: true

      // Warning: enabling resolvers level metrics will introduce significant overhead
      resolvers: true,
    })
  ]
})
```
