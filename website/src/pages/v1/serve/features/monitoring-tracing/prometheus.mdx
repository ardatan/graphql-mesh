# Prometheus

[Prometheus](https://www.prometheus.io/) is a platform for scraping metrics from services and
utilities. You can use `@graphql-mesh/plugin-prometheus` plugin to expose and collect metrics from
all phases of your GraphQL execution including internal query planning and outgoing HTTP requests.

This plugin tracks the complete gateway execution flow.

The metrics gathered are then exposed in a format that Prometheus can scrape on a regular basis on
an HTTP endpoint (`/metrics` by default).

## Getting Started

First, please install the Mesh prometheus plugin and the community prometheus client for Node.js.

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @graphql-mesh/plugin-prometheus prom-client
```

You can then add the plugin and its configuration to your `mesh.config.ts` file.

```ts filename="mesh.config.ts"
import usePrometheus from '@graphql-mesh/plugin-prometheus'
import { defineConfig as defineServeConfig } from '@graphql-mesh/serve-cli'

export const serveConfig = defineServeConfig({
  // ...other options

  plugins: pluginCtx => [
    usePrometheus({
      ...pluginCtx,

      // Enable the metrics you want to expose
      // In this example, we enable incoming and outgoing HTTP request durations metrics
      http: true
      fetchMetrics: true
    })
  ]
})
```

You can now start your Mesh gateway and make some requests to it. The plugin will start collecting
metrics, and you can access them by visiting the `/metrics` endpoint.

## Exposed Metrics

By default, the plugin will not expose any metrics. You need to opt in to the metrics you wish to
export.

In the metrics, you will find the timing of each phase of the GraphQL execution. If you are not
familiar with the lifecycle of a GraphQL operation in Mesh, please refer to the
[Plugin Lifecycle page](/v1/serve/features/custom-plugins#plugin-lifecycle). Each plugin hook has a
corresponding metric which tracks timings as
[histograms](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#histogram) or
[summary](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#summary). You will also find some
[counters](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#counter) to track the number of
requests, errors, and other useful information.

To enable a metric, set the corresponding option to `true`. You can also provide a string to
customize the metric name, or an object to provide more options (see
[`siimon/prom-client` documentation](https://github.com/siimon/prom-client#custom-metrics)).

Each metric also exposes some labels to give more context. Please see details sections of each
metric to see the available labels. Some labels can be enabled or disabled using the `labels`
option.

### `graphql_yoga_http_duration`

This metric tracks the duration of incoming (downstream) HTTP requests. It reports the time spent to
process each incoming request as a
[histogram](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#histogram).

It is useful to track the responsiveness of your gateway. A spike in this metric could indicate a
performance issue and that further investigation is needed.

Please note that this metric is not specific to GraphQL, it tracks all incoming HTTP requests.

You can use labels to have a better understanding of the requests and group them together. A common
filter is to include only `statusCode` with `200` value and `method` with `POST` (the default method
for GraphQL requests, but it can also be `GET` depending on your client setup) value to get
execution time of successful GraphQL requests only.

To enable this metric, set the `http` option to `true`.

#### Labels

This metric includes some useful labels to help you identify requests and group them together.

| Label           | Enabled by default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------- | :----------------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `method`        |  Not configurable  | The HTTP method used to request the gateway endpoint.<br/><br/> Since GraphQL usually only uses `POST` requests, this can be used to filter out GraphiQL-related requests. <br/><br/> It can be any HTTP verb, including disallowed ones. Which means this metric can also be used to track malformed or malicious requests.                                                            |
| `statusCode`    |  Not configurable  | The HTTP status code returned by the gateway.<br/><br/>You probably want to filter out non-`200` responses to have a view of the successful requests.<br/><br/>This can help you identify which requests are failing and why. Since GraphQL errors are returned as `200 OK` responses, this can be useful to track errors that are not related to the GraphQL, like malformed requests. |
| `operationName` |       `true`       | If available, the name of the GraphQL operation requested, otherwise `Anonymous`.<br/><br/>This can help you identify which operations are slow or failing.<br/><br/>We recommend you always provide an operation name to your queries and mutations to help performance analysis and bug tracking.                                                                                     |
| `operationType` |       `true`       | The type of the GraphQL operation requested. It can be one of `query`, `mutation`, or `subscription`.<br/><br/>This can help you differentiate read and write performance of the system. It can for example help understand cache impact.                                                                                                                                               |

### `graphql_mesh_fetch_duration`

This metric tracks the duration of outgoing HTTP requests. It reports the time spent on each request
made using the `fetch` function provided by Mesh. It is reported as a
[histogram](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#histogram).

This metric can provide insights into the network usage of your gateway. It does not only include
requests made to resolve GraphQL operation responses, but also include any other outgoing HTTP
requests made by Mesh or one of its plugins. It will for example include requests made to fetch the
supergraph schema from the configured Schema Registry.

To enable this metric, set the `fetchMetrics` option to `true`.

#### Labels

These metrics include some useful labels to help you identify requests and group them together.

| Label             | Enabled by default | Description                                                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `url`             | Not configurable   | The URL of the upstream request.                                       |
| `method`          | Not configurable   | The HTTP method of the upstream request.                               |
| `statusCode`      | Not configurable   | The status code of the upstream response.                              |
| `statusText`      | Not configurable   | The status text of the upstream response.                              |
| `requestHeaders`  | `false`            | A JSON encoded object containing the headers of the upstream request.  |
| `responseHeaders` | `fasle`            | A JSON encoded object containing the headers of the upstream response. |

queries made to resolve incoming operations as a
[histogram](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#histogram).

This metric can provide insights into how the time is spent to resolve queries. It can help you
identify bottlenecks in your subgraphs.

To enable this metric, set the `subgraphExecute` option to `true`.

#### Labels

| Label           | Enabled by default | Description                                                                                                            |

```

### `graphql_mesh_subgraph_execute_errors`

This metric tracks the number of errors that occurred during the subgraph execution. It counts all
errors found in the response returned by the subgraph execution. It is exposed as a
[counter](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#counter).

This metric can help you identify subgraphs that are failing to execute operations. It can help
identify issues with the subgraph itself or the communication between the gateway and the subgraph.

To enable this metric, set the `subgraphExecuteErrors` option to `true`.

#### Labels

| Label           | Enabled by default | Description                                                                                                            |

| `operationName` |       `true`       | The name of the GraphQL operation executed by the subgraph. It will be `Anonymous` if no `operationName` is found.     |

#### Sample Output

```
# HELP graphql_mesh_subgraph_execute_errors Number of errors on subgraph execution
# TYPE graphql_mesh_subgraph_execute_errors counter
graphql_mesh_subgraph_execute_errors{subgraphName="upstream",operationType="query",operationName="Anonymous"} 1
```

### `graphql_envelop_phase_parse`

This metric tracks the duration of the `parse` phase of the GraphQL execution. It reports the time
spent parsing the incoming GraphQL operation. It is reported as a
[histogram](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#histogram).

Since you don't have control over the parsing phase, this metric is mostly useful to track potential
attacks. A spike in this metric could indicate someone is trying to send malicious operations to
your gateway.

To enable this metric, set the `parse` option to `true`.

#### Labels

### `graphql_envelop_phase_validate`

This metric tracks the duration of the `validate` phase of the GraphQL execution. It reports the
time spent validating the incoming GraphQL operation. It is reported as a
[histogram](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#histogram).

To enable this metric, set the `validate` option to `true`.

#### Labels

| Label           | Enabled by default | Description                                                                                             |

### `graphql_envelop_phase_context`

This metric tracks the duration of the `context` phase of the GraphQL execution. It reports the time
spent building the context object that will be passed to the executors. It is reported as a
[histogram](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#histogram).

### `graphql_envelop_phase_execute`

This metric tracks the duration of the `execute` phase of the GraphQL execution. It reports the time
spent actually resolving the response of the incoming operation. This includes the gathering of all
the data from all sources required to construct the final response. It is reported as a
[histogram](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#histogram).

It is the metric that will give you the most insights into the performance of your gateway, since
this is where most of the work is done.

To enable this metric, set the `execute` option to `true`.

### `graphql_envelop_phase_subscribe`

This metric tracks the duration of the `subscribe` phase of the GraphQL execution. It reports the
time spent initiating a subscription (which doesn't include actually sending the first response). It
is reported as a [histogram](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#histogram).

It will notably include the time spent to setup upstream subscriptions with appropriate transport
for each source.

To enable this metric, set the `subscribe` option to `true`.

### `graphql_envelop_request_duration`

This metric tracks the duration of the complete GraphQL operation execution. It reports the time
spent in the GraphQL specific processing, excluding the HTTP-level processing. It is reported as a
[histogram](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#histogram).

To enable this metric, set the `requestTotalDuration` option to `true`.

### `graphql_envelop_request_time_summary`

This metric provides a summary of the time spent on the GraphQL operation execution. It reports the
same timing than [`graphql_envelop_request_duration`](#graphql_envelop_request_duration) but as a
[summary](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#summary).

To enable this metric, set the `requestSummary` option to `true`.

### `graphql_envelop_error_result`

This metric tracks the number of errors that occurred returned by the GraphQL execution.

Similarly to [`graphql_mesh_subgraph_execute_errors`](#graphql_mesh_subgraph_execute_errors), it
counts all errors found in the final response constructed by Mesh after it gathered all subgraph
responses, but it also includes errors from other GraphQL processing phases (parsing, validation and
context building). It is exposed as a
[counter](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#counter).

To enable this metric, set the `errors` option to `true`.

#### Labels

Depending on the phase when the error occurred, some labels may be missing. For example, if the
error occurred during the context phase, only the `phase` label will be present.

| Label           | Enabled by default | Description                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------- | :----------------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `path`          |       `true`       | The path of the field that caused the error. It can be `undefined` if the error is not related to a given field.                                                      |
| `phase`         |       `true`       | The phase of the GraphQL execution where the error occurred. It can be `parse`, `validate`, `context`, `execute` (for every operation types including subscriptions). |
| `operationType` |       `true`       | The type of the GraphQL operation requested. This can be one of `query`, `mutation`, or `subscription`.                                                               |
| `operationName` |       `true`       | The name of the GraphQL operation requested. It will be `Anonymous` if no `operationName` is found.                                                                   |

#### Sample Output

```
# HELP graphql_envelop_error_result Counts the amount of errors reported from all phases
# TYPE graphql_envelop_error_result counter
graphql_envelop_error_result{operationName="Anonymous",operationType="query",path="undefined",phase="execute"} 1
```

### `graphql_envelop_request`

This metric tracks the number of GraphQL operations executed. It counts all operations, either
failed or successful, including subscriptions. It is exposed as a
[counter](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#counter).

It can differ from the number reported by
[`graphql_yoga_http_duration_sum`](#graphql_yoga_http_duration) because a single HTTP request can
contain multiple GraphQL operations if batching has been enabled.

To enable this metric, set the `requestCount` option to `true`.

#### Filter resolvers to instrument

To mitigate the cost of instrumenting all resolvers, you can explicitly list the fields that should
be instrumented by providing a list of field names to the `instrumentResolvers` option.

It is a list of strings in the form of `TypeName.fieldName`. For example, to instrument the `hello`
root query, you would use `Query.hello`.

You can also use wildcards to instrument all the fields for a type. For example, to instrument all
root queries, you would use `Query.*`.

#### Labels

| Label           | Enabled by default | Description                                                                                             |
| --------------- | :----------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `operationType` |       `true`       | The type of the GraphQL operation requested. This can be one of `query`, `mutation`, or `subscription`. |
| `operationName` |       `true`       | The name of the GraphQL operation requested. It will be `Anonymous` if no `operationName` is found.     |

#### Sample output

```
# HELP graphql_envelop_request Counts the amount of GraphQL requests executed through Envelop
# TYPE graphql_envelop_request counter
graphql_envelop_request{operationName="Anonymous",operationType="query"} 1
```

### `graphql_envelop_deprecated_field`

This metric tracks the number of deprecated fields used in the GraphQL operation.

To enable this metric, set the `deprecatedFields` option to `true`.

#### Labels

| Label           | Enabled by default | Description                                                                                             |
| --------------- | :----------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fieldName`     |       `true`       | The name of the deprecated field that has been used.                                                    |
| `typeName`      |       `true`       | The name of the parent type of the deprecated field that has been used.                                 |
| `operationType` |       `true`       | The type of the GraphQL operation requested. This can be one of `query`, `mutation`, or `subscription`. |
| `operationName` |       `true`       | The name of the GraphQL operation requested. It will be `Anonymous` if no `operationName` is found.     |

#### Sample Output

```
# HELP graphql_envelop_deprecated_field Counts the amount of deprecated fields used in selection sets
# TYPE graphql_envelop_deprecated_field counter
graphql_envelop_deprecated_field{operationName="Anonymous",operationType="query",fieldName="hello",typeName="Query"} 1
```

### `graphql_envelop_schema_change`

This metric tracks the number of schema changes that have occurred since the gateway started. When
polling is enabled, this will include the schema reloads.

If you are using a plugin that modifies the schema on the fly, be aware that this metric will also
include updates made by those plugins. Which means that one schema update can actually trigger
multiple schema changes.

To enable this metric, set the `schemaChangeCount` option to `true`.

#### Labels

This metric does not include any labels.

#### Sample output

```
# HELP graphql_envelop_schema_change Counts the amount of schema changes
# TYPE graphql_envelop_schema_change counter
graphql_envelop_schema_change 1
```

### `graphql_envelop_execute_resolver`

<Callout type="warning">
  Enabling resolvers level metrics will introduce significant overhead. It is recommended to enable
  this metric only for debugging purposes.
</Callout>

This metric tracks the duration of each resolver execution. It reports the time spent only on
additional resolvers, not on fields that are resolved by a subgraph. It is up to the subgraph server
to implement resolver level metrics, the gateway can't remotely track their execution time.

#### Labels

```

## Skip introspection queries

By default, all operations are instrumented, including introspection queries. It is possible to
ignore introspection queries for all metrics prefixed by `graphql_envelop_` by setting the
`skipIntrospection` option to `true`.

## Custom Registry

You can customize the client’s registry by passing a custom registry to the `registry` option.

```ts filename="mesh.config.ts"
import { Registry } from 'prom-client'
import usePrometheus from '@graphql-mesh/plugin-prometheus'
import { defineConfig as defineServeConfig } from '@graphql-mesh/serve-cli'

const myRegistry = new Registry()

export const serveConfig = defineServeConfig({
  plugins: pluginCtx => [
    usePrometheus({
      ...pluginCtx,
      registry: myRegistry
    })
  ]
})
```
