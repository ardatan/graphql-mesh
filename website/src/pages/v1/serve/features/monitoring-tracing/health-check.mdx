# Health Check Endpoints

Hive Gateway is aware of the usefulness of a health check and gives the user maximum possibilities
to use the built-in check.

## Types of health checks

There are two types of health checks: **liveliness** and **readiness**, they both _are_ a health
check but convey a different meaning:

- **Liveliness** checks whether the service is alive and running
- **Readiness** checks whether the upstream services are ready to perform work

The difference is that a service can be _live_ but not _ready_ - for example, server has started and
is accepting requests (alive), but the read replica it uses is still unavailable (not ready).

### Liveliness

By default, you can check whether the gateway is alive by issuing a request to the `/healthcheck`
endpoint and expecting the response `200 OK`.

Of course, you can change this endpoint through the `healthCheckEndpoint` option.

```ts filename="gateway.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-hive/gateway'

export const gatewayConfig = defineConfig({
  healthCheckEndpoint: '/healthcheck'
})
```

A successful response is just `200 OK` without a body.

### Readiness

Additionally, we have another endpoint which checks whether the services powering Hive Gateway are
ready to perform work.

```ts filename="gateway.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-hive/gateway'

export const gatewayConfig = defineConfig({
  readinessCheckEndpoint: '/readiness'
})
```

It returns `200 OK` if all the services are ready to perform work.
