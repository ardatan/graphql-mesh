# Sentry

This plugin collects errors and performance tracing for your execution flow, and reports it to
[Sentry](https://sentry.io).

This is how it looks like in Sentry for error tracking:

> The operation name, document, variables are collected on errors, and the breadcrumbs that led to
> the error. You can also add any custom values that you need.

And for performance tracking:

> You can get information about each resolver (including field and type names), it's execution time
> and arguments. Also, in case of an error, the performance log and info are attached automatically
> to the reported Sentry error.

## Getting Started

```sh
yarn add @sentry/node @sentry/tracing @envelop/sentry
```

1. Start by creating an account and a project in https://sentry.io
2. Follow the instructions to setup your Sentry instance in your application.
3. Setup Sentry global instance configuration.
4. Setup the Envelop plugin.

## Usage Example

```ts filename="mesh.config.ts"
import { useSentry } from '@envelop/sentry'
import { defineConfig as defineServeConfig } from '@graphql-mesh/serve-cli'
// do this only once in you entry file.
import '@sentry/tracing'

export const serveConfig = defineServeConfig({
  plugins: () => [
    useSentry({
      includeRawResult: false, // set to `true` in order to include the execution result in the metadata collected
      includeResolverArgs: false, // set to `true` in order to include the args passed to resolvers
      includeExecuteVariables: false, // set to `true` in order to include the operation variables values
      appendTags: args => {}, // if you wish to add custom "tags" to the Sentry transaction created per operation
      configureScope: (args, scope) => {}, // if you wish to modify the Sentry scope
      skip: executionArgs => {} // if you wish to modify the skip specific operations
    })
  ]
})
```

### Configuration

- `startTransaction` (default: `true`) - Starts a new transaction for every GraphQL Operation. When
  disabled, an already existing Transaction will be used.
- `renameTransaction` (default: `false`) - Renames Transaction.
- `includeRawResult` (default: `false`) - Adds result of each resolver and operation to Span's data
  (available under "result")
- `includeExecuteVariables` (default: `false`) - Adds operation's variables to a Scope (only in case
  of errors)
- `appendTags` - See example above. Allow you to manipulate the tags reports on the Sentry
  transaction.
- `configureScope` - See example above. Allow you to manipulate the tags reports on the Sentry
  transaction.
- `transactionName` (default: operation name) - Produces a name of Transaction (only when
  "renameTransaction" or "startTransaction" are enabled) and description of created Span.
- `traceparentData` (default: `{}`) - Adds tracing data to be sent to Sentry - this includes
  traceId, parentId and more.
- `operationName` - Produces a "op" (operation) of created Span.
- `skip` (default: none) - Produces a "op" (operation) of created Span.
- `skipError` (default: ignored `GraphQLError`) - Indicates whether or not to skip Sentry exception
  reporting for a given error. By default, this plugin skips all `GraphQLError` errors and does not
  report it to Sentry.
- `eventIdKey` (default: `'sentryEventId'`) - The key in the error's extensions field used to expose
  the generated Sentry event id. Set to `null` to disable.
