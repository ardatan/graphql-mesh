# Extend Your Gateway

GraphQL Mesh Serve Runtime can be extended with feature flags and additional plugins. This allows
you to add more features to your GraphQL Mesh Gateway, such as rate limiting, caching, and more.
This documentation section covers most of the possible features that you can add with simple
additions.

GraphQL Mesh also allows you to hook into the different phases of the lifecycle from the client to
the upstream services by using custom plugins that you can
[learn more here](/v1/serve/features/custom-plugins).

  We'd recommend to check the available features and plugins on the left sidebar, because we believe
  some of them can be useful for your use case.
