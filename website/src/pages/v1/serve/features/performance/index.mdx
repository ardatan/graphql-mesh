# Performance & Caching

GraphQL Mesh Serve Runtime provides a set of features to help you optimize the performance of your
GraphQL Mesh Gateway. GraphQL Mesh provides a shared caching storage that can be used across
plugins, transforms and subgraph execution.

## Providing Cache Storage

In order to enable features that need a storage to keep the data, you need to define a cache storage
implementation, and pass it to the `gatewayConfig`.

You can choose the best-fit cache storage for your use case.

### LocalForage

LocalForage is a library that improves the existing storage mechanism in the browser by using
`IndexedDB`, `WebSQL` and `localStorage`, [see more](https://github.com/localForage/localForage).

Even if it is known as a browser storage, GraphQL Mesh provides you as a platform-agnostic cache
storage to leverage the well-known storage APIs that are available in most JavaScript environments.

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @graphql-mesh/cache-localforage
```

```ts filename="gateway.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-mesh/serve-cli'
import LocalForageCacheStorage from '@graphql-mesh/cache-localforage'

export const gatewayConfig = defineConfig({
  cache: new LocalForageCacheStorage({
    // All of the following options are listed with default values, you don't need to provide them
    driver: ['WEBSQL', 'INDEXEDDB', 'LOCALSTORAGE'] // The order of the drivers to use
    name: 'GraphQLMesh', // The name of the database
    version: 1.0, // The version of the database
    size: 4980736, // The size of the database
    storeName: 'keyvaluepairs', // The name of the store
    description: 'Cache storage for GraphQL Mesh', // The description of the database
  }),
  plugins: pluginCtx => ([
    // Your plugins here
    useResponseCache({
      ...pluginCtx, // To pass the shared cache storage
      // other configuration
    })
  ])
})
```

### Redis

Redis is an in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker. You can
use Redis as a cache storage for your GraphQL Mesh Gateway.

<Callout>The Redis cache currently only works in Node.js environments.</Callout>

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @graphql-mesh/cache-redis
```

```ts filename="gateway.config.ts"
import RedisCacheStorage from '@graphql-mesh/cache-redis'
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-mesh/serve-cli'

export const gatewayConfig = defineConfig({
  cache: new RedisCacheStorage({
    host: 'localhost', // The host of the Redis server
    port: 6379, // The port of the Redis server
    password: undefined, // The password of the Redis server
    lazyConnect: true, // If true, the connection will be established when the first operation is executed
    // or
    url: 'redis://localhost:6379' // The URL of the Redis server
  }),
  plugins: pluginCtx => [
    // Your plugins here
    useResponseCache({
      ...pluginCtx // To pass the shared cache storage
      // other configuration
    })
  ]
})
```

### Cloudflare Workers KV

Cloudflare Workers KV is a distributed, eventually consistent key-value store available in the
Cloudflare Workers runtime. You can use Cloudflare Workers KV as a cache storage for your GraphQL
Mesh Gateway. [Learn more about KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/kv/)

<Callout>
  This is only available for Cloudflare Workers runtime. If you want to learn how to deploy your
  GraphQL Mesh Gateway to Cloudflare Workers, you can check the [deployment
  documentation](/v1/serve/deployment/cloudflare-workers).
</Callout>

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @graphql-mesh/cache-cf-kw
```

```ts filename="gateway.config.ts"
import CloudflareKVCacheStorage from '@graphql-mesh/cache-cf-kw'
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-mesh/serve-cli'

export const gatewayConfig = defineConfig({
  cache: new CloudflareKVCacheStorage({
    namespace: 'GraphQLMesh' // The namespace of the KV
  }),
  plugins: pluginCtx => [
    // Your plugins here
    useResponseCache({
      ...pluginCtx // To pass the shared cache storage
      // other configuration
    })
  ]
})
```

## Custom Cache Storage

You can also implement your own cache storage by extending the `CacheStorage` class. It needs to
match `KeyValueCache` interface from `@graphql-mesh/serve-runtime`.

```ts filename="my-cache-storage.ts"
import { LRUCache } from 'lru-cache'
import { KeyValueCache } from '@graphql-mesh/serve-runtime'

export class MyKeyValueCache<V = any> implements KeyValueCache<V> {
  // Your cache implementation here
  private cache = new LRUCache<string, V>()

  // Get the value of the key
  async get(key: string) {
    return this.cache.get(key)
  }

  // Set the key with the value and optional options
  async set(key: string, value: V, options?: { ttl?: number }) {
    this.cache.set(key, value, options?.ttl)
  }

  // Delete the key from the cache
  async delete(key: string) {
    this.cache.del(key)
  }

  // Get all keys that match the given prefix
  async getKeysByPrefix(prefix: string) {
    return Array.from(this.cache.keys()).filter(key => key.startsWith(prefix))
  }

  // This should be implemented if you want to clear the cache on shutdown
  [Symbol.asyncDispose]() {
    this.cache.reset()
  }
}
```
