# Execution Cancellation

In the real world, a lot of HTTP requests are dropped or canceled. This can happen due to a flakey
internet connection, navigation to a new view or page within a web or native app or the user simply
closing the app. In this case, the server can stop processing the request and save resources.

That is why GraphQL Mesh comes with the support for canceling the GraphQL execution upon request
cancellation.

So any extra calls to the services can be stopped and the resources can be saved.

## Enable Execution Cancellation

```ts filename="gateway.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-mesh/serve-cli'

export const gatewayConfig = defineConfig({
  executionCancellation: true
})
```

That is all you need to do to enable execution cancellation in your Mesh gateway. Theoretically, you
can enable this and immediately benefit from it without making any other adjustments within your
GraphQL schema implementation.

If you want to understand how it works and how you can adjust your resolvers to properly cancel
pending promises (e.g. database reads or HTTP requests), you can continue with the next section.

  You can also use the same plugin with your subgraph configuration if you use GraphQL Yoga. [See
  more](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/yoga-server/docs/features/execution-cancellation)

  Also this can be combined with [Upstream
  Cancellation](/v1/serve/features/performance/upstream-cancellation) that does this cancellation
  not only in the execution level but also on the upstream HTTP level.
