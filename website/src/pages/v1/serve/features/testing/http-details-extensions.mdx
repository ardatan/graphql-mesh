You can expose the details of outgoing HTTP requests done by GraphQL Mesh source handlers within
extensions property of the GraphQL execution.

This can be useful for debugging purposes, especially when you want to see the details of the HTTP
request and response.

## How to use?

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @graphql-mesh/plugin-http-details-extensions
```

Then, add it to your plugins:

```ts filename="mesh.config.ts"
import useHTTPDetailsExtensions from '@graphql-mesh/plugin-http-details-extensions'
import { defineConfig as defineServeConfig } from '@graphql-mesh/serve-cli'

export const serveConfig = defineServeConfig({
  plugins: [
    useHTTPDetailsExtensions({
      // You can provide a custom condition to enable/disable the plugin
      if: () => process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'
    })
  ]
})
```

Then you can see the details of the HTTP request and response in the extensions property of the
GraphQL execution.
