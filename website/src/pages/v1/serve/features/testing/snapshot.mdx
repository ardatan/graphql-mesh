The `snapshot` plugin allows applying snapshot for development usage.

The snapshot plugin writes the responses of your remote data source to your file system and then
uses it instead of re-fetching it every time. Itâ€™s also helpful because you can easily manipulate
your data manually and see how your API mesh responds.

To get started with this plugin, install it:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @graphql-mesh/plugin-snapshot
```

Then, add it to your plugins:

```ts filename="mesh.config.ts"
import useSnapshot from '@graphql-mesh/plugin-snapshot'
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-mesh/serve-cli'

export const serveConfig = defineConfig({
  plugins: pluginCtx => [
    useSnapshot({
      ...pluginCtx,
      // You can provide a custom condition to enable/disable the plugin
      if: () => process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development',
      // The directory where the snapshots will be stored
      outputDir: '__snapshots__',
      // The origins to apply the snapshot
      apply: ['https://my-remote-api.com/*']
    })
  ]
})
```

The following snapshot will work if you are in a development environment (see the `if` command).

To modify your snapshots and change the responses, go to `__snapshots__` and modify the responses
under those files.
