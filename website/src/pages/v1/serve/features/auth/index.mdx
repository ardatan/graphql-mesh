## Authentication

Authentication is the process of identifying who is doing a request against your server. Rolling out
your own authentication solution is a crucial and important task as any flaws can result in severe
security issues.

- [JSON Web Tokens (JWT)](/v1/serve/features/auth/jwt): Mesh provides a plugin to easily integrate
  JWT token verification into your API.
- [Generic Auth](/v1/serve/features/auth/generic-auth): In some cases using a third party auth
  provider is not possible. But now worries, the generic auth plugin has you covered!

## Authorization

Authorization is the process of allowing or denying the authenticated (or sometimes unauthenticated)
user to access information. Since GraphQL is a graph, applying authorization based on field
resolvers is handy and allows fine-grained control.

Your GraphQL graph might become quite complicated over time, having a strategy for ensuring correct
authorization as the graph grows is mandatory.

Most of the time this logic should be applied within your business logic that is called within your
resolvers, however, for some use-cases it is possible to apply authorization rules before any
execution is even happening. E.g. if we want to prevent the execution of a GraphQL operation that
selects fields the viewer is not allowed to see.

- [Operation Field Permissions](/v1/serve/features/auth/operation-field-permissions): You can
  automatically reject GraphQL operations that include specific field selections within the
  operations selection set.
