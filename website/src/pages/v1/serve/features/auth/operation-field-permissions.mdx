# Allow-List Operation Fields

With this plugin you can automatically reject GraphQL operations that include specific field
selections within the operations selection set. It works by extracting a set of schema coordinates
from the context object. A custom validation rule will verify whether the selection only includes
allowed selections and prevent the execution of the operation if it encounters any prohibited
selections.

This plugin is perfect for use-cases where you want the whole schema being introspectable, but
restrict access to a certain part of the Graph only to specific users. E.g. in a payment
subscription model, where API users should only have access to the data that is included within the
plan.

Basically, it disallows executing operations that select certain fields. It is useful if you want to
restrict the scope of certain public API users to a subset of the public GraphQL schema, without
triggering execution (e.g. how graphql-shield works).

## How to use?

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @envelop/operation-field-permissions
```

Then, add it to your plugins:

```ts filename="gateway.config.ts"
import { useOperationFieldPermission } from '@envelop/operation-field-permissions'
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-hive/gateway'

export const gatewayConfig = defineConfig({
  plugins: pluginCtx => [
    useOperationFieldPermission({
      // we can access graphql context here
      // `context` has `request` object that includes `headers` etc.
      // See [Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) for more information
      getPermissions: async context => new Set(['Query.greetings'])
    })
  ]
})
```
