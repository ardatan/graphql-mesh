Authentication in the process of identifying who is trying to access our API. Building our own
solution can be hard and cause severe security issue if done wrong. In recent years third-party
authentication providers became quite popular. One of those is Auth0, which comes with an
exceptional free plan allowing up to 7.000 active users and unlimited logins, making it one of the
best available solutions for getting started.

In this guide we will go through all the steps required for integrating authentication into an
existing mesh setup using the [`@envelop/auth0`](https://www.envelop.dev/plugins/use-auth0) package.
