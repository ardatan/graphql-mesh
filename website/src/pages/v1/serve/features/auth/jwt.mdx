A [JSON Web Tokens (JWT)](https://jwt.io/) is a signed token containing arbitrary informations,
commonly used for authentication. By being signed by the issuer of the token, it can be verified
that the token is valid and has not been tampered with.

GraphQL Mesh provides a plugin to easily integrate JWT into your API.

## How to use?

Install the plugin:

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @graphql-yoga/plugin-jwt
```

Then, add it to your plugins:

```ts filename="mesh.config.ts"
import { defineConfig as defineServeConfig } from '@graphql-mesh/serve-cli'
import { useJWT } from '@graphql-yoga/plugin-jwt'

export default defineServeConfig({
  plugins: () => [
    useJWT({
      issuer: 'http://graphql-yoga.com',
      signingKey
    })
  ]
})
```

Then during Authorization, for example within a plugin like
[Operation Field Permissions](/v1/serve/features/security/auth/operation-field-permissions), you can
use the `jwt` property of the context to access the decoded JWT token:

```ts filename="mesh.config.ts"
import { useOperationFieldPermissions } from '@envelop/operation-field-permissions'

useOperationFieldPermissions({
  getPermissions: async context => {
    const { jwt } = context
    if (jwt?.role === 'admin') {
      return new Set(['Query.*'])
    }
    return new Set(['Query.greetings'])
  }
})
```
