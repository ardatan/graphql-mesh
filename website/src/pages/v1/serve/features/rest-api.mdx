# Generate REST API using SOFA

GraphQL SOFA allows you to generate a fully documented REST API from your GraphQL schema. This is
useful when you need to support REST clients or when you want to expose a REST API to the public.

import { Callout } from '@theguild/components'

- **Don’t choose between REST and GraphQL**
- Get most of the **benefits of GraphQL** on the backend and frontend, while using and **exposing
  REST**
- **Support all your existing clients** with REST while improving your backend stack with GraphQL
- Create custom, perfectly client-aligned REST endpoints for your frontend simply by naming a route
  and attaching a query
- In the other way around (REST to GraphQL) you won’t get the best of both worlds. Instead just less
  powerful, harder-to-maintain server implementations with a some of the benefits of GraphQL. It can
  be a good and fast start for a migration though.
- Fully **generated documentation** that is always up-to-date
- **GraphQL Subscriptions as Webhooks**

## Installation

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @graphql-yoga/plugin-sofa

## Quick Start

```ts filename="mesh.config.ts"
import { defineConfig as defineServeConfig } from '@graphql-mesh/serve-cli'
import { useSOFA } from '@graphql-yoga/plugin-sofa'

export const serveConfig = defineServeConfig({
  plugins: pluginCtx => [
    useSOFA({
      // The path where the REST API will be served
      basePath: '/rest',
      // The path where the Swagger UI will be served
      swaggerUIEndpoint: '/rest/docs',
      // OpenAPI Document details
      info: {
        title: 'My API',
        description: 'My API Description',
        version: '1.0.0'
      }
