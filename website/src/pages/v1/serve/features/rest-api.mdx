# Generate REST API using SOFA

<Callout>
  This page is currently under construction and expected to change. Please feel free to reach out to
  us directly in case you are having any troubles.

GraphQL SOFA allows you to generate a fully documented REST API from your GraphQL schema. This is
useful when you need to support REST clients or when you want to expose a REST API to the public.

- **Don’t choose between REST and GraphQL**
- Get most of the **benefits of GraphQL** on the backend and frontend, while using and **exposing
  REST**
- **Support all your existing clients** with REST while improving your backend stack with GraphQL
- Create custom, perfectly client-aligned REST endpoints for your frontend simply by naming a route
  and attaching a query
- In the other way around (REST to GraphQL) you won’t get the best of both worlds. Instead just less
  powerful, harder-to-maintain server implementations with a some of the benefits of GraphQL. It can
  be a good and fast start for a migration though.
- Fully **generated documentation** that is always up-to-date
- **GraphQL Subscriptions as Webhooks**
