Rate limiting is a technique for reducing server load by limiting the number of requests that can be
made to a subgraph.

You can use `@graphql-mesh/plugin-rate-limit` plugin in order to limit the rate of calling queries
and mutations.

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @graphql-mesh/plugin-rate-limit
```

## Example Configuration

```ts filename="gateway.config.ts"
import useRateLimit from '@graphql-mesh/plugin-rate-limit'
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-mesh/serve-cli'

export const gatewayConfig = defineConfig({
  plugins: pluginCtx => [
    useRateLimit({
      ...pluginCtx,
      rules: [
        {
          type: 'Query',
          field: 'foo',
          max: 5, // requests limit for a time period
          ttl: 5000, // time period
          // You can use any value from the context
          identifier: '{context.headers.authorization}'
        }
      ]
    })
  ]
})
```

## Configuration on Subgraph level with `@rateLimit` directive

<Callout>
  If you want to use schema-first approach with `@rateLimit` directive, you can check the [Rate
  Limiting through `@rateLimit` directive](/v1/compose/rate-limit) documentation.
