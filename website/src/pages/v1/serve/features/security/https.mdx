# Secure HTTP Connection (HTTPS)

HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) is an encrypted version of the HTTP protocol. It uses TLS
to encrypt all communication between a client and a server.

There are different ways to secure the connection. It is either between the client and Hive Gateway
or between Hive Gateway and the subgraphs.

<Callout>This is only available on Node environment.</Callout>

## Subgraph - Gateway Connection

Hive Gateway acts as a client to the subgraphs, so if you want to have a secure connection in
between Hive Gateway and the subgraphs, you can use HTTPs.

### Using Self-Signed Certificates

But if you use self-signed certificates, Hive Gateway may not verify the certificate by default,
then you need to provide those certificates to Hive Gateway.

#### Environment Variables

Hive Gateway's default HTTP Client implementation respects Node's environment variables related to
this;

- `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` - If set to `0`, it disables the rejection of self-signed
  certificates.
- `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` - If set, it provides a path to a CA certificate file.

Below is an example of how to use self-signed certificates with Hive Gateway;

```sh
NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=/path/to/ca.crt hive-gateway supergraph <path-to-supergraph-config>
```

#### Configuration File

The only way to configure HTTPS programmaticaly is to use a custom agent like below;

```ts
import { readFileSync } from 'fs'
import { Agent } from 'https'
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-hive/gateway'

const agent = new Agent({
  ca: readFileSync('/path/to/ca.crt')
  // or
  rejectUnauthorized: false
})

export const gatewayConfig = defineConfig({
  // This function will be called for each URL to determine if the custom agent should be used
  customAgent: ({ url }) =>
        url === 'https://example.com'
          ? agent
          : undefined
})
```

## Client - Gateway Connection

You can also configure Hive Gateway to listen on HTTPS. You can provide the path to the key and
certificate files in the configuration file;

```ts
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-hive/gateway'

export const gatewayConfig = defineConfig({
  sslCredentials: {
    key_file_name: 'path/to/key.pem',
    cert_file_name: 'path/to/cert.pem',
    passphrase: 'passphrase'
  },
  port: 443
})
```
