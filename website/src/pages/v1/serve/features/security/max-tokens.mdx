# Max Tokens

**Limit** the number of **tokens** in a GraphQL document.

It is used to prevent **DOS attack**, **heap overflow** or **server overloading**.

The token limit is often limited by the graphql parser, but this is not always the case and would
lead to a fatal heap overflow.

[Provided by GraphQL Armor](https://escape.tech/graphql-armor/docs/plugins/max-tokens)

## How to use?

Install the plugin:

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @escape.tech/graphql-armor-max-tokens
```

Then, add it to your plugins:

```ts filename="gateway.config.ts"
import { maxTokensPlugin } from '@escape.tech/graphql-armor-max-tokens'
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-hive/gateway'

export const gatewayConfig = defineConfig({
  plugins: () => [
    maxTokensPlugin({
      // Toggle the plugin | Default: true
      enabled: true,
      // Number of tokens allowed | Default: 5000
      n: 5000,
      // Do you want to propagate the rejection to the client? | default: true
      propagateOnRejection: true,
      // List of queries that are allowed to bypass the plugin
      allowList: [],

      /* Advanced options (use here on your own risk) */

      // Callbacks that are ran whenever a Query is accepted
      onAccept: [],

      // Callbacks that are ran whenever a Query is rejected
      onReject: []
    })
  ]
})
```
