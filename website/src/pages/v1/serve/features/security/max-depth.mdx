# Max Depth

**Limit** the **depth** of a GraphQL document.

It is used to prevent too large queries that could lead to overfetching or **DOS attack**.

[Provided by GraphQL Armor](https://escape.tech/graphql-armor/docs/plugins/max-depth)

## How to use?

Install the plugin:

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @escape.tech/graphql-armor-max-depth
```

Then, add it to your plugins:

```ts filename="gateway.config.ts"
import { maxDepthPlugin } from '@escape.tech/graphql-armor-max-depth'
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-hive/gateway'

export const gatewayConfig = defineConfig({
  plugins: () => [
    maxDepthPlugin({
      // Toggle the plugin | Default: true
      enabled: true,
      // Depth threshold | default: 6
      n: 6,
      // Do you want to propagate the rejection to the client? | default: true
      propagateOnRejection: true,
      // List of queries that are allowed to bypass the plugin
      allowList: [],

      /* Advanced options (use here on your own risk) */

      // Callbacks that are ran whenever a Query is accepted
      onAccept: [],

      // Callbacks that are ran whenever a Query is rejected
      onReject: []
    })
  ]
})
```
