**Limit** number of **characters** in a GraphQL query document.

This plugin helps you to prevent **DoS attacks** by hard-limiting the size of the query document.

[Provided by GraphQL Armor](https://escape.tech/graphql-armor/docs/plugins/character-limit)

## How to use?

Install the plugin:

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @escape.tech/graphql-armor-character-limit
```

Then, add it to your plugins:

```ts filename="mesh.config.ts"
import { characterLimitPlugin } from '@escape.tech/graphql-armor-character-limit'
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-mesh/serve-cli'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: () => [
    characterLimitPlugin({
      maxLength: 15000 // Number of characters allowed | Default: 15000
    })
  ]
})
```

  - We recommend using the [Max Tokens Plugin](/v1/serve/features/security/max-tokens) instead of
  this one. - This plugin does not limit the size of input variables. - This plugin relies on a
  parser plugin to works and access query document through the context.
