# Block Field Suggestions

This is a feature that allows you to prevent **returning field suggestions** and **leaking your
schema** to unauthorized actors provided by
[GraphQL Armor](https://escape.tech/graphql-armor/docs/plugins/block-field-suggestions/)

In production, this can lead to Schema leak even if the introspection is disabled.

## How to use?

Install the plugin:

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @escape.tech/graphql-armor-block-field-suggestions
```

Then, add it to your plugins:

```ts filename="mesh.config.ts"
import { blockFieldSuggestionsPlugin } from '@escape.tech/graphql-armor-block-field-suggestions'
import { defineConfig as defineServeConfig } from '@graphql-mesh/serve-cli'

export default defineServeConfig({
  plugins: () => [
    blockFieldSuggestionsPlugin({
      // Toggle the plugin | Default: true
      enabled: true,
      // Mask applied to the error message | default: '[Suggestion hidden]'
      mask: '[Suggestion hidden]'
    })
  ]
})
```
