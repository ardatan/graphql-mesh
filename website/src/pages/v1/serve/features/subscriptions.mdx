# Subscriptions

GraphQL Mesh fully supports federated subscriptions and behaves just like
[Apollo Federation GraphQL subscriptions](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/executing-operations/subscription-support).

Subgraphs providing subscriptions can communicate with Mesh through one of the following protocols:

- [GraphQL over SSE](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http/blob/main/rfcs/GraphQLOverSSE.md)
- [GraphQL over WebSocket](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http/blob/main/rfcs/GraphQLOverWebSocket.md)
- ~[HTTP Callback](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/executing-operations/subscription-callback-protocol/)~
  ([coming soon!](https://github.com/ardatan/graphql-mesh/issues/7209))

## Example

We'll implement two
[GraphQL Yoga federation services](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/yoga-server/docs/features/apollo-federation#federation-service)
behaving as subgraphs. The "products" service exposes a subscription operation type for subscribing
to product changes, while the "reviews" service simply exposes review stats about products.

The example is somewhat similar to
[Apollo's documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/executing-operations/subscription-support/#example-execution),
except for that we use GraphQL Yoga here and significantly reduce the setup requirements.

### Install dependencies

```ssh npm2yarn
npm i graphql-yoga @apollo/subgraph graphql
```

### Products service

```ts filename="products.ts"
import { createServer } from 'http'
import { parse } from 'graphql'
import { createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { buildSubgraphSchema } from '@apollo/subgraph'
import { resolvers } from './my-resolvers'

const typeDefs = parse(/* GraphQL */ `
  type Product @key(fields: "id") {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    price: Int!
  }

  type Subscription {
    productPriceChanged: Product!
  }
`)

const yoga = createYoga({ schema: buildSubgraphSchema([{ typeDefs, resolvers }]) })

const server = createServer(yoga)

server.listen(40001, () => {
  console.log('Products subgraph ready at http://localhost:40001')
})
```

### Reviews service

```ts filename="reviews.ts"
import { createServer } from 'http'
import { parse } from 'graphql'
import { createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { buildSubgraphSchema } from '@apollo/subgraph'
import { resolvers } from './my-resolvers'

const typeDefs = parse(/* GraphQL */ `
  extend type Product @key(fields: "id") {
    id: ID! @external
    reviews: [Review!]!
  }

  type Review {
    score: Int!
  }
`)

const yoga = createYoga({ schema: buildSubgraphSchema([{ typeDefs, resolvers }]) })

const server = createServer(yoga)

server.listen(40002, () => {
  console.log('Reviews subgraph ready at http://localhost:40002')
})
```

### Start Gateway

After having generated a supergraph file `supergraph.graphql` for the two subgraphs, either using
[Mesh Compose](/v1/compose) or [Apollo Rover](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/), simply run
Mesh Serve without any additional configuration!

```sh
mesh-serve --supergraph=supergraph.graphql
```

### Subscribe

Let's now subscribe to the product price changes by executing the following query:

```graphql
subscription {
  productPriceChanged {
    # Defined in Products subgraph
    name
    price
    reviews {
      # Defined in Reviews subgraph
      score
    }
  }
}
```

Mesh will inteligently resolve all fields on subscription events and deliver you the complete
result.

You can subscribe to the gateway through Server-Sent Events (SSE) (in JavaScript, using
[EventSource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource) or
[graphql-sse](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/sse)). For the sake of brevity, we'll subscribe using
`curl`:

```sh
curl 'http://localhost:4000/graphql' \
  -H 'accept: text/event-stream' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{"query":"subscription OnProductPriceChanged { productPriceChanged { name price reviews { score } } }","operationName":"OnProductPriceChanged"}'
```

## Subgraphs using WebSockets

If your subgraph uses WebSockets for subscriptions support
([like with Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/data/subscriptions/)),
Mesh Serve will need additional configuration pointing to the WebSocket server path on the subgraph.

We'll optionally install `@graphql-mesh/transport-http` first to have type-safety when defining the
transport options.

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @graphql-mesh/transport-http
```

And configure Mesh Serve to use the `/subscriptions` path on the "products" subgraph for WebSocket
connections:

```ts filename="mesh.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-mesh/serve-cli'
import type { HTTPTransportOptions } from '@graphql-mesh/transport-http'

export const serveConfig = defineConfig({
  supergraph: 'supergraph.graphql',
  transportOptions: {
    // use "*" to apply options to all subgraphs
    products: {
      http: {
        subscriptions: {
          ws: {
            // the location of the WS server is ws://<location>/subscriptions
            path: '/subscriptions'
          }
        }
      } satisfies HTTPTransportOptions
    }
  }
})
```

Now simply start Mesh Serve with:

```sh
mesh-serve
```

Downstream clients are still subscribing to Mesh Serve gateway through any supported subscriptions
protocol, but upstream Mesh Serve will use long-living WebSocket connections to the "products"
service.

### `Authorization` header

Mesh Server will propagate the downstream client's `Authorization` header contents to the upstream
WebSocket connections through the
[`ConnectionInit` message payload](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http/blob/main/rfcs/GraphQLOverWebSocket.md#connectioninit).

The contents of the payload will be available in `graphql-ws` connectionParams:

```json
{
  "connectionParams": {
    "token": "<CONTENTS_OF_AUTHORIZATION_HEADER>"
  }
}
```

<Callout>
  This is also what Apollo Router when [propagating auth on
  WebSockets](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/executing-operations/subscription-support/#websocket-auth-support).

## Closing active subscriptions on schema change

When the schema changes in Mesh, all active subscriptions will be completed after emitting the
following execution error:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "subscription has been closed due to a schema reload",
      "extensions": {
        "code": "SUBSCRIPTION_SCHEMA_RELOAD"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

<Callout>
  This is also what Apollo Router when [terminating subscriptions on schema
  update](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/executing-operations/subscription-support/#termination-on-schema-update).
</Callout>
