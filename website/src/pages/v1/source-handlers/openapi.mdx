# OpenAPI / Swagger

This handler allows you to load remote or local [OpenAPI (2/3) and Swagger](https://swagger.io)
schemas. This work originated from IBM Research, and is currently maintained by GraphQL Mesh.

You can import it using remote/local `.json` or `.yaml`.

## How to use?

To get started, install the handler library:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @omnigraph/openapi
```

Then you can import the library in your configuration file, and define your OpenAPI/Swagger source;

```ts filename="mesh.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-mesh/compose-cli'
import { loadOpenAPISubgraph } from '@omnigraph/openapi'

export const composeConfig = defineConfig({
  subgraphs: [
    {
      sourceHandler: loadOpenAPISubgraph('Wiki', {
        source: 'https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/wikimedia.org/1.0.0/swagger.yaml'
      })
    }
  ]
})
```

## Overriding default Query/Mutation operations classification

By default, all GET operations will be placed into Query fields and all other operations into
Mutation fields. with this option, you can manually override this process. To switch between Query
and Mutation operations, and vice versa, you need to define a rule per override, consisting of the
OAS title, the path of the operation, the method of the operation and finally, the destination type
(e.g., Query or Mutation). See the example below:

```ts filename="mesh.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-mesh/compose-cli'
import { loadOpenAPISubgraph } from '@omnigraph/openapi'

export const composeConfig = defineConfig({
  subgraphs: [
    {
      sourceHandler: loadOpenAPISubgraph('Wiki', {
        source: './my-schema.json',
        selectQueryOrMutationField: [
          {
            fieldName: 'add_weather_forecast', // OAS field name
            type: 'Query' // switch method POST from default Mutation into Query
          },
          {
            fieldName: 'get_weather_forecast', // OAS field name
            type: 'Mutation' // switch method GET from default Query into Mutation
          }
        ]
      })
    }
  ]
})
```

## Naming convention

We use `operationId` for the names, and aim to keep it as close as possible to origin.

### Type naming

We adjust `operationId` only when necessary according to the GraphQL spec: - Chars ` ` (white
space), `.`, `/`, `:` and `-` are replaced with `_` (underscore) - Other chars which are not
latin/digits are replaced with their char codes - If first char of the name is a digit, we prefix it
with `_` (GraphQL spec doesnâ€™t allow that)

### Unnamed types

We use path-based naming. So names could be structured like, for example,
`query_getUsers_items_firstName`

## Headers

[Read about configuration and examples](/v1/source-handlers#setting-headers)

## Callbacks as Subscriptions

OpenAPI handler is able to process OAS Callbacks as GraphQL Subscriptions. It uses your PubSub
implementation to consume the data. But you have to define webhooks for individual callbacks to make
it work.

See
[Subscriptions & Webhooks](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/mesh/v1/subscriptions-webhooks)
to create an endpoint to consume a webhook. You should use the callback url as `pubSubTopic` in the
webhook configuration.

Also see our example;
[Subscriptions Example with Webhooks](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/ardatan/graphql-mesh/tree/master/examples/v1-next/openapi-subscriptions).
