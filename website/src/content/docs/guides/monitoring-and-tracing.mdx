# Monitoring and Tracing

If something is not working as it should within your GraphQL gateway, you would not want it to go
unnoticed.

You can use Gateway plugins to trace and monitor your gateway's execution flow together with all
outgoing HTTP calls and internal query planning.

> Gateway plugins are mostly the extended versions of
> [the existing Envelop plugins.](https://www.envelop.dev/docs/guides/monitoring-and-tracing)
