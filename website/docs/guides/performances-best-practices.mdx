A Mesh Gateway that does is not properly configured will face the same famous issue as any other GraphQL servers: **the N+1 Query problem**.

Fortunately, GraphQL Mesh provides a way to batch requests with specific `additionalResolvers` parameters.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Enable requests batching

Our [`multiple-sources`](https://github.com/charlypoly/graphql-mesh-docs-first-gateway/tree/master/packages/multiple-sources) example Gateway:

<Graph>

graph TD;
subgraph AA [" "]
A[Mobile app];
B[Web app];
C[Node.js client];
end
subgraph BB [" "]
E[Books REST API];
F[Authors gRPC API];
G[Stores GraphQL API];
end
Z[Mesh Gateway GraphQL API];
A --> Z;
B --> Z;
C --> Z;
Z --> E;
Z --> F;
Z --> G;

</Graph>

Will emit multiple requests to the "Authors" API when resolving the nested `Book.author` field:

```graphql
query bestSellersByStore {
  stores {
    id
    name
    bookSells {
      sellsCount
      book {
        id
        title
        author {
          id
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Book.author resolver->>Authors API: GetAuthor(input: \{ id: "332" \})

</Graph>

Fortunately, Mesh allows an extra directive-based configuration to provide a "batching" query that will help resolve many record of the same type.

Our current resolver configuration for `Book.author` is the following:

_[`.meshrc.yaml`](https://github.com/charlypoly/graphql-mesh-docs-first-gateway/tree/master/packages/multiple-sources/.meshrc.yaml)_

```yaml
sources:
  # ...
transforms:
  # ...
additionalTypeDefs: |
  # ...
  extend type Book {
    author: authors_v1_Author @resolveTo(
      sourceName: "Authors", # Which source does the target field belong to?
      sourceTypeName: "Query", # Which root type does the target field belong to?
      sourceFieldName: "authors_v1_AuthorsService_GetAuthor", # What is the source field name?
      requiredSelectionSet: "{ authorId }",
      # What args does this need to take?
      sourceArgs: {
        "input.id": "{root.authorId}"
      }
    )
  }
```

Assuming that the "Authors" is exposing a `authors_v1_AuthorsService_GetAuthors(input: authors_v1_GetAuthorsRequest_Input)` with `authors_v1_GetAuthorsRequest_Input` being:

```graphql
input authors_v1_GetAuthorsRequest_Input {
  ids: [String!]!
}
```

We could update our `.meshrc.yaml` configuration as follows:

_`.meshrc.yaml`_

```yaml
sources:
  # ...
transforms:
  # ...

# Create a resolver with batching to solve N+1 problem
additionalTypeDefs: |
  # ...
  extend type Book {
    author: authors_v1_Author @resolveTo(
      targetTypeName: "Book",
      targetFieldName: "author",
      sourceFieldName: "authors_v1_AuthorsService_GetAuthors",
      keyField: "authorId",
      keysArg: "input.ids"
    )
  }
```

`requiredSelectionSet` and `sourceArgs` got replaced by `keyField` and `keysArg`:

- `keysArg` provides the name of the batching primary key argument (`input.ids` from `authors_v1_GetAuthorsRequest_Input`)
- `keyField` indicates which `Book` selection-set field should be used to provide the `ids` value

Now, our Mesh Gateway will try to batch calls to the "Authors" API when resolving `Book.author`:

Book.author resolver->>Authors API: GetAuthors(input: \{ ids: ["123", "754", "332"] \})
