Thanks to its server based on [GraphQL Yoga](https://www.graphql-yoga.com/), GraphQL Mesh provides file upload support out of the box.

Similarly, just a few configuration changes will be necessary to forward file uploads to Sources.

## Sources file uploads


The following Gateway integrates a "UploadFiles" Source that has file upload capabilities:


<Graph>

graph TD;
subgraph BB [" "]
E[ResizeImages API];
F[UploadFiles API];
end
Z[Mesh Gateway GraphQL API];
Z --> E;
Z --> F;

</Graph>


To support forwarding file uploads to the "UploadFiles" Source, we will need to add the `maxRequestBodySize` to the `serve` configuration:

_[`.meshrc.yaml`](https://github.com/Urigo/graphql-mesh/tree/master/examples/graphql-file-upload-example/.meshrc.yml)_
```yaml
# ...

serve:
  maxRequestBodySize: 10mb

```

<br />

You will find the complete example in [`examples/graphql-file-upload-example/.meshrc.yml`](https://github.com/Urigo/graphql-mesh/tree/master/examples/graphql-file-upload-example/.meshrc.yml).

## Custom resolvers file uploads


Custom resolvers, programatically provided by `additionalResolvers`, can also support File uploads (ex: upload to S3).

For this, the only configuration step would be to define the `File` scalar to enable file-uploads and our file uplo:

_`.meshrc.yaml`_
```yaml
sources:
  # ...
transforms:
  # ...
additionalTypeDefs: |
  scalar Upload

  extend Mutation {
    uploadFile(upload: Upload!): File!
  }

additionalResolvers:
    - "./resolvers"
```

Then the resolvers would look as follow:

__`resolvers.ts`__
```ts
import { Resolvers } from './.mesh'

const resolvers: Resolvers = {
  Mutation: {
    uploadFile: async (_, { upload }) => {
      const filename = upload.name;
      const arrayBuffer = await upload.arrayBuffer();
      const buffer = Buffer.from(arrayBuffer);

      // upload file to S3...

      return { filename };
    },
  },
}

export default resolvers
```
