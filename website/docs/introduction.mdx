GraphQL Mesh is a framework to **build GraphQL Gateways on top of GraphQL and non-GraphQL services** (REST, gRPC, and more).

Many approaches exist to build a GraphQL Gateway:

- creating an Apollo Server with Apollo DataSource to query sub-services
- creating a GraphQL Gateway from scratch using GraphQL tools (ex: `stitchSchemas()`)
- use Apollo Federation

However, most of those approaches [require much coding, maintenance or don't support non-GraphQL sub-services](/docs/getting-started/comparison).

GraphQL Mesh has been built with **productivity and developer experience in mind**.

Building and serving a unified GraphQL schema as a Gateway has never been easier; thanks to many helpful features:

- Consume **many API/Sources types** (SOAP, REST, GRPC, Databases, [and more](/docs/handlers/handlers-introduction))
- Embedded **performant and extensible GraphQL Server** ([GraphQL Yoga](https://www.graphql-yoga.com/) + [Envelop](https://www.graphql-yoga.com/))
- **Apply transforms** to the unified schema (ex: naming convention)
- **Extend** the unified schema with custom resolvers
- **Caching** strategies
- Add **mocks** for Schema development

Already used in production by community members and [some of our clients](https://www.the-guild.dev/services), GraphQL Mesh is useful for:
- Build a **unified GraphQL Schema that follows the industry best practices** (schema design, performances)
- Combine multiple GraphQL services as a **unified Schema with subscriptions support**
- **Progressively migrate existing non-GraphQL services** under a unified GraphQL API (REST, gRPC, SOAP)
- **Quickly give a try to GraphQL** by translating an existing REST API to a GraphQL Gateway
