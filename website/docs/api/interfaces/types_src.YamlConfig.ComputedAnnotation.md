# Interface: ComputedAnnotation

[types/src](../modules/types_src).[YamlConfig](../modules/types_src.YamlConfig).ComputedAnnotation

specifies a selection of fields required from other services to compute the value of this field.
These additional fields are only selected when the computed field is requested.
Analogous to [computed field](https://www.graphql-tools.com/docs/stitch-type-merging#computed-fields) in merged type configuration.
Computed field dependencies must be sent into the subservice using an [object key](https://www.graphql-tools.com/docs/stitch-directives-sdl#object-keys).
