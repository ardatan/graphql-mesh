Thanks to its flexible architecture and embedded server relying on [GraphQL Yoga](https://www.graphql-yoga.com/) and [Envelop](https://www.envelop.dev/), **GraphQL Mesh can be deployed anywhere**!

We already saw that `mesh dev` could be used for local development.

Similarly, Mesh provides a `mesh start` CLI command for production environments.

`mesh start` can be used for all environments supporting starting a webserver (Heroku, Digital Ocean, etc).

Setup Mesh on a Serverless environment requires some integration work, detailed below.

## Deploy Mesh with `mesh start`

While `mesh dev` handles the generation of the SDK code, `mesh start` expects to load the Gateway schema and runtime from the `.mesh/` folder.

This mechanism helps:
- __reducing the start time of the server__: no build step is required
- __preventing starting failure if one of the Sources is unreachable__: we don't fetch the API definition file at startup, ensuring that the fetched definitions are validated at build time


To deploy a Mesh Gateway, you need to ensure that `mesh build` is called during the deployment, for example, with a `prebuild` step:

_package.json_
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "mesh start",
    // will be run during deployment
    "prebuild": "mesh build"
  }
}
```

For more information about the embedded Mesh server configuration, please [refer to the `serve` reference documentation](/docs/getting-started/customize-mesh-server#configuration-serve-reference).

## Deploy Mesh on Serverless

Serverless deployment requires some integration since we cannot keep the `mesh start` server running.


<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Deploy Mesh on Vercel with Next.js API Routes

First, let's ensure that `mesh build` will be run during deployment.

Vercel - list most platforms, and run `yarn build` for deployment.
For this reason, we will add a `prebuild` step:

_package.json_
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "mesh start",
    // will be run during deployment
    "prebuild": "mesh build"
  }
}
```

<br />

Now, let's integrate our Mesh Gateway in a Next.js API Routes using GraphQL Yoga:

_website/src/pages/api/graphql/index.ts_
```ts
import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/node';
import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';
import { getBuiltMesh } from './.mesh';

async function buildServer() {
  // retrieve the mesh instance (with configured Envelop plugins)
  const mesh = await getBuiltMesh();
  // pass the Mesh instance to Yoga and configure GraphiQL
  const server = createServer({
    plugins: mesh.plugins,
    graphiql: {
      endpoint: '/api/graphql',
      title: 'Mesh Gateway',
    },
  });

  return server;
}

// avoids building the server at each request!
const server$ = buildServer();

export default async function apiHandler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  return server$.requestListener(req, res);
}
```


<br />

A complete example is found at [website/src/pages/api/covid/index.ts](https://github.com/Urigo/graphql-mesh/blob/master/website/src/pages/api/covid/index.ts).

### Deploy Mesh on AWS Lambda

Similarly to regular and Vercel deployment, we will need to add the `mesh build` command in the build step.

Then, we can create a Lambda as it follows:

_`graphql.ts`_
```ts
import type { Handler } from '@aws-cdk/aws-lambda'
import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/node'
import { configure } from '@vendia/serverless-express'
import { getBuiltMesh } from './.mesh';

// retrieve the mesh instance (with configured Envelop plugins)
const mesh = await getBuiltMesh();
// pass the Mesh instance to Yoga and configure GraphiQL
const app = createServer({
  plugins: mesh.plugins,
  graphiql: {
    endpoint: '/api/graphql',
    title: 'Mesh Gateway',
  },
});

export const handler: Handler = configure({
  // Pass Yoga as app
  app,
  // Pass Yoga's logger to listen to the logs from Serverless Express as well
  log: app.logger,
})
```

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Deploy Mesh on Cloudflare Workers

Similarly to regular and Vercel deployment, we will need to add the `mesh build` command in the build step.

Then,

_`listener.mjs`_
```ts
import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/common'

import { getBuiltMesh } from './.mesh';

// retrieve the mesh instance (with configured Envelop plugins)
const mesh = await getBuiltMesh();
// pass the Mesh instance to Yoga and configure GraphiQL
const server = createServer({
  plugins: mesh.plugins,
  graphiql: {
    endpoint: '/api/graphql',
    title: 'Mesh Gateway',
  },
});

server.start()
```

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Mesh and Docker

A GraphQL Mesh Gateway should be treated like any Node.js project while keeping in mind that a `mesh build` step should be added to the deployment steps.

**Any Node.js Docker image is suitable for GraphQL Mesh deployment**: [https://hub.docker.com/_/node](https://hub.docker.com/_/node).
