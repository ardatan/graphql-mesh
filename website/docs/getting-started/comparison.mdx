title: What is the difference between Mesh, Federation, Hasura, and GraphQL Tools?

As stated in the introduction page, many approaches exist to build a GraphQL Gateway:

- creating an Apollo Server with Apollo DataSource to query sub-services
- creating a GraphQL Gateway from scratch using GraphQL tools (ex: `stitchSchemas()`)
- use Apollo Federation
- use Hasura on top of a Postgres with custom Actions

<br />

The comparison table below evaluates all those solutions based on 3 criteria:

1. How is the solution helping you build Unified Schema Gateway in a **productive and maintainable way**?
2. Is the solution provides all the features to build a **well-designed Unified GraphQL Schema**? (comprehensive, simplified abstraction of a set of sub-services)
3. Which **sub services types** the solution supports?
