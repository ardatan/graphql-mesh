Working with Mesh means dealing with 4 main concepts: _Sources_, _Handlers_, _Transforms_ and _Unified Schema_:

- In Mesh, a sub-service (GraphQL API, REST API) is called a _Source_.
- Sources are translated to GraphQL Schema with the appropriate _Handler_.
- Then, all Sources' GraphQL Schema are merged into a final _Unified Schema_.
- Finally, if applicable, configured transformations, called _Transforms_, are applied to the _Unified Schema_.


<Graph>

  graph LR;
    subgraph A [GraphQL Mesh server]
      A0[Unified Schema]
      subgraph A1 [Configured sources]
        subgraph A11 [City Source]
          A111[City Source GraphQL Schema]
        end
        subgraph A12 [Population Source]
          A121[Population GraphQL Schema]
        end
        subgraph A31 [Weather Source]
          A311[Weather GraphQL Schema]
        end
      end
    end
    A111 & A121 & A311-- merges in --> A0
    subgraph B [Services]
      subgraph B1 [City REST API]
        B11[Swagger definition file]
      end
      subgraph B2 [Population GraphQL API]
        B21[GraphQL Schema]
      end
      subgraph B3 [Weather REST API]
        B31[RAML definition file]
      end
    end
    B11--translates to GraphQL Schemas by handler-->A111
    B21--translates to GraphQL Schemas by handler-->A121
    B31--translates to GraphQL Schemas by handler-->A311

</Graph>

The above GraphQL Mesh Gateway has 3 configured _Sources_:
- The "City" _Source_ configured with the `@graphql-mesh/openapi` _Handler_.
- The "Population" _Source_ configured with the `@graphql-mesh/graphql` _Handler_.
- The "Weather" _Source_ configured with the `@graphql-mesh/raml` _Handler_.

<br />

_Sources_, _Handlers_, _Transforms_ are configured in a `.mesh.yaml` (or `.json`, `.js`) configuration file that defines:
- How to fetch the definition of the sub-services (GraphQL API, REST API, and more)
- What transformations should be applied to the unified schema (_optional_)
- The path to the declaration of custom resolvers (_optional_)
- Which cache strategy should be used? (_optional_)
- Which envelop plugins should be loaded and configured at the server level? (_optional_)

<br />

Let's have a closer look to a `.mesh.yaml` configuration file by [installing Mesh](/docs/getting-started/installation) and [building our first Gateway](/docs/your-first-mesh-gateway)!
