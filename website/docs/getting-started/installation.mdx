GraphQL Mesh comes in multiple packages, which you should install according to your needs.

## Mesh CLI, the core package

To get started, let's first install locally the Mesh CLI package (and dependencies):

<PackageInstall packages="graphql @graphql-mesh/cli" />

_Note: Avoid installing Mesh CLI as a global dependency_

## Handlers and Transforms packages

As stated previously, Mesh comes in many packages.

Each _Source Handler_ and _Transforms_ are shipped as dedicated packages, for example:

- The _Handler_ to configure a REST API Source requires the `@graphql-mesh/openapi` package
- The naming convention _Transforms_ requires the `@graphql-mesh/transform-naming-convention` package

Mesh will display a helpful error message when using a _Handler_ or _Transforms_ that is not properly installed.

The full list of [Source Handler packages can be found here](/docs/handlers/handlers-introduction), same for [Transforms packages](/transforms/transforms-introduction).
