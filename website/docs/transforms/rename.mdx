The `rename` transform allows you to rename:
- GraphQL types
- GraphQL fields
- GraphQL field arguments

<PackageInstall packages="@graphql-mesh/transform-rename" />

## How to use?

Add the following configuration to your Mesh config file:

```yaml
transforms:
  - rename:
      mode: bare | wrap
      renames:
        # rename type
        - from:
            type: ApiUser
          to:
            type: User
        # rename type fields
        - from:
            type: Query
            field: apiUser
          to:
            type: Query
            field: user
        # rename field arguments
        - from:
            type: Query
            field: user
            argument: user_id
          to:
            type: Query
            field: user
            argument: userId
```

> `type` and `field` are mandatory to rename a field argument with `argument`.

or you can use regular expressions to rename multiple types, fields or both

```yaml
- rename:
    mode: bare | wrap
    renames:
      - from:
          type: Api(.*)
        to:
          type: $1
        useRegExpForTypes: true

      - from:
          type: Query
          field: api(.*)
        to:
          type: Query
          field: $1
        useRegExpForFields: true
```
